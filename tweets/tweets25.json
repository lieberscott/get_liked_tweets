In every cafe I sat in, I was told ”A Jew was stabbed right here”, and ” A shooting happened on the other side of this street a few months ago.” \n\nThroughout this trip, I have been ex-communicated by close-minded friends and family members. But you know what? It was worth it. Because I got to see Israel and experience the truth about the country that I was indoctrinated to hate for myself. \n\nI wish that my friends and family members would also be able to visit Israel and see the beauty and hospitality of the country like I did. I was able to swiftly visit Israel because of my Swedish passport – I won’t deny my privileges. \n\nBut I also have the elusive privilege of humanizing both Israelis and Arabs. I had the greatest privilege of meeting, and seeing and talking to Israelis, whom I had learned to hate since I was a child. \n\nI am so happy to have cleansed the hatred out of my soul. I wish that the Muslim and Arab communities could do the same. \n\nNothing good can ever come out of hatred, violence, and terrorism. And now, having been in Israel, I cannot stress enough how much it saddens me that my culture and my people have learned to hate this country and these people. \n\nTo all the Israelis who have opened their hearts and homes to me and showed me their beautiful country - thank you."

        "text": "I have to say, these past two months have been extraordinarily clarifying. I will never waste a second of my life wondering  if women’s rights orgs and movements actually care about women. The answer is clear: They do not. \n\nThey do not care when Israeli women are sexually violated and brutally gang raped by genocidal terrorists. Even when it is filmed for the world to see, they would prefer to look the other way, downplay — or worse — outright deny.\n\nBut make no mistake: If they don’t care about *some* women, they don’t care about any women. It’s all a charade, funded by those who want to feel good, not do good. So they pour their money into organizations purporting to the do the work.\n\nThe heads of such organizations line their own pockets as women half a world away are dragged into Gaza by their hair in blood-stained sweatpants. As women are being raped next to their dead friends’ bodies. As women are begging their rapists to kill them since they were going to do it anyway. \n\nWomen’s rights orgs don’t care about women. They never did."

        "text": "As reports come out that Israel is preparing to flood Gaza's tunnels with seawater, it is instructive to look at 2015, when Egypt did the same thing to destroy the smuggling tunnels under Rafah to Gaza.\n\nAt the time, mainstream media criticism was quite muted. Egypt's government obviously hated Hamas, linked to the hated Muslim Brotherhood, The flooding was meant to hurt Hamas economically as a large part of its revenue stream at the time came from taxing goods illegally smuggled through those tunnels.\n\nAl Jazeera and other pro-Hamas news sites were more critical, saying that the flooding would damage groundwater supplies, houses could be destroyed by landslides caused by the collapsing tunnels, and the people whose livelihoods depended on smuggling would be hurt. \n\nThe funny thing about the coverage is that while Gazans were upset, they emphasized that they still loved their brothers in Egypt - who were trying to destroy their economy. \n\nIf Israel decides to do it, though, we will see the \"dirty water\" and \"landslide\" narratives to be far more prevalent than in 2015. There will also be one word dominating the coverage that no one heard in 2015: \"genocide.\"  Because when Jews do something, even with far more care not to damage things than Egypt ever would, they are always  much more guilty.\n\nIt is fascinating to see how Egypt, which refuses to allow Gazans safe haven, is  still regarded by Gazans as their friends. \n\nBecause they aren't Jewish."

They're not separate things, they're the same thing, one thing. And yet no prominent Democrat has said, \"I have made a mistake. I will change my mind.\" They lose their voices shrieking \"Trump, Trump, Trump,\" but never once look in the mirror to see the demon staring back at them. We on the right have all sorts of flaws and troubles and blind spots, but the left is sliding into the abyss."

The mob shouted for a ceasefire while screaming for an \"intifada\" (violent uprising) & the genocide of all Israeli Jews (\"from the river to the sea\"). \n\nTactic: #3 Engage in intimidating violence or vandalism: Protestors defaced several businesses near @Penn, spray-painting anti-Israel slogans like \"F**k the IDF,\" \"Intifada\" & \"Free Palestine\" on businesses, restaurants and banks.\n\nTactic #4: Piggy-back anti-Israel protests with unrelated \"intersectional\" causes. The Sunday rally in Philly bizarrely doubled as a vigil for University City Townhomes. It had speakers decry both gentrification and the Gaza conflict. WATCH",

          "text": "BREAKING: HAMAS OFFICIAL STATEMENT \n\n“We reject the occupation’s lies about cases of rape, which aim to distort the resistance and cover up the image of its humane and moral dealings with detainees.\n\nWe strongly reject and denounce the alignment of some Western media outlets with the misleading Zionist campaigns that promote unfounded lies and allegations aimed at demonizing the Palestinian resistance, the latest of which is the allegation that resistance members committed “sexual violence” during the Al-Aqsa Flood Battle on October 7.\n\nWe consider this misleading campaign to be part of a series of lies spread by the Zionist propaganda machine, whose claims have been proven false, especially the falsehood of beheading children and targeting revelers at the concert in the Re’im settlement, and not the least of which is the lie of using Al-Shifa Medical Hospital for military purposes.\n\nThe Nazi Zionist occupation seeks to spread rumors and lies against the resistance in a desperate attempt to cover up the image that the world saw of the humane and moral dealings with detainees and their good care among the resistance men, which a number of released detainees testified to, despite the occupation’s attempts to cover up and obscure it.\n\nWe call on all media outlets and agencies to be careful not to fall into the trap of the occupation’s lies and tendentious propaganda, and to verify every information, to protect the truth and preserve the sanctity of the media message.”"
