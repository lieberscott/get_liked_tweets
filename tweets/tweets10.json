It's a story about a boy whose house was invaded by terrorists on Saturday morning, shot his stepfather, took his step-sisters and his mother and held them hostage inside the house. The terrorists went live on Facebook and recorded every minute. This is a story about a boy who a moment ago fell asleep and woke up to a nightmare at 6 in the morning, one boy that the terrorists forced him to go through all the neighbor's houses in the kibbutz, knock on their doors and ask them to come out. One brave boy who sat upright without crying in front of monsters with weapons, one brave boy who went door to door and tried to convince the terrorists that there was no one in the neighbors' houses. One child who was torn from his mother's arms and from the moment Kem did not see her again, one child whom the terrorists used and murdered with unimaginable cruelty in front of his mother and then murdered her as well. This is a story about Tomer, Tomer Arava who entered my heart and tore it to pieces on October 7th, this is a story about a hero who is only 17 years old and will never return. This is his last picture - a hostage in his home holding his mother's hand.\n#October7massacre\n#HamasTerrorists\n#the_slaughter710",

        "text": "The evil of Palestinian Terrorism knows no bounds.  \nThe other day I posted a story about a four-year old Palestinian child who was found wandering in Gaza by IDF soldiers.  They took care of her, giving her food and drink and returned her to the Gazans through the International Red Cross.  Now it turns out that she was not an innocent lost waif.  Rather she had been sent by the Palestinian Terrorists to scout out the whereabouts of the IDF troops and report back so that the Terrorists could attack the Israeli soldiers.  \n\nYesterday, a Palestinian terrorist hid out under the wheelchair  of an elderly Gazan woman.  When the IDF soldiers approached, the Terrorist opened fire. \nFreed hostage Mia Schem reported in an interview that she was held captive by a Palestinian family with women and children.  Her conclusion:  all of Gaza is Hamas.  \n\nIt really doesn't matter whether all Palestinians support Hamas.  Most do and want to see more like October 7th.  That doesn't make them legitimate cannon fodder, but it does illustrate the challenges facing Israel as it acts to eradicate Palestinian Terror and create the conditions for normalcy on the borders of the world's only Jewish State.  \n\nWishing all a peaceful weekend wherever you may be."

When the terrorists entered the Nova festival Ben didn't know where to run, he didn't know what to do and how to react, Ben and his roommate who spent time with him at the party decided to hide in a water canal, they sat there for about two hours in silence. At some point the terrorists noticed the water channel, discovered them and murdered them with a brutality that is hard to describe, Ben's body was found four days after he was murdered. A man who came to search for missing persons in the area arrived a few days later in the canal area, he noticed a bag at the entrance and decided to crawl inside, where he found Ben's cell phone, he ran to the car and charged it to check who it belonged to, and then the last video was discovered - in the background of the incessant gunshots and screams, Ben sat in the water channel in a yoga position and meditated in his last moments, his hands were in the pose of peace - Ben came to terms with his death and parted ways with the world.  This is his last picture.\n#October7massacre\n#HamasTerrorists",

        "text": "Undeniable evidence and multiple verified accounts of Hamas brutal rape on October 7th, confirmed by the New York Times: \n\nThe first victim she said she saw was a young woman with copper-color hair, blood running down her back, pants pushed down to her knees. One man pulled her by the hair and made her bend over. Another penetrated her, Sapir said, and every time she flinched, he plunged a knife into her back.\n\nShe said she then watched another woman “shredded into pieces.” While one terrorist raped her, she said, another pulled out a box cutter and sliced off her breast.\n\n“One continues to rape her, and the other throws her breast to someone else, and they play with it, throw it, and it falls on the road,” Sapir said.\n\nShe said the men sliced her face and then the woman fell out of view. Around the same time, she said, she saw three other women raped and terrorists carrying the severed heads of three more women.\n\nSapir provided photographs of her hiding place and her wounds, and police officials have stood by her testimony and released a video of her, with her face blurred, recounting some of what she saw.\n\nYura Karol, a 22-year-old security consultant, said he was hiding in the same spot, and he can be seen in one of Sapir’s photos. He and Sapir were part of a group of friends who had met up at the party. In an interview, Mr. Karol said he barely lifted his head to look at the road but he also described seeing a woman raped and killed.\n\nhttps://t.co/dGCQzQtg9d"

When the terrorists entered the party area, Eric had time to call his second daughter and told her: \"We barely have reception, everyone ran away, I don't know where to go,\" and the call was cut off. Where will Eric go? How will he run with Ruth But he picked her up and ran with her, all Eric wanted was to save her life. But the monsters came to them and murdered them with unimaginable cruelty, which is hard to describe. Ruth's wheelchair was found abandoned in the field. 12 days after the massacre, Eric's mutilated body was found and he was brought for burial. Ruth continued to be searched for another two weeks, then Ruth's mother had a dream in which Ruth appeared hugging her father Eric and told her: \"Don't worry we are together\", the family insisted, the authorities decided to reopen Eric's grave where it was discovered - Eric and Ruth were buried together.

Stop pretending like Palestinians ever tried anything other than terrorism and violence to advance their agenda.\n\nYou will also notice Mehdi intentionally omitted 1948-1967 when Jordan and Egypt controlled The West Bank and Gaza respectively and did not give Palestinians a state then. \n\nPalestinian leaders have consistently prioritized the destruction of Israel over pursuing self-determination for their own people so they have not been able to get a state. That will continue as long as people like Mehdi suggest that they have zero responsibility in abandoning terrorism to pursue a peaceful settlement."

One man pulled her by the hair and made her bend over. Another penetrated her, Sapir said, and every time she flinched, he plunged a knife into her back.\n\nShe said she then watched another woman “shredded into pieces.” While one terrorist raped her, she said, another pulled out a box cutter and sliced off her breast.\n\n“One continues to rape her, and the other throws her breast to someone else, and they play with it, throw it, and it falls on the road,” Sapir said.\n\nShe said the men sliced her face and then the woman fell out of view. Around the same time, she said, she saw three other women raped and terrorists carrying the severed heads of three more women.\n\nSapir provided photographs of her hiding place and her wounds, and police officials have stood by her testimony and released a video of her, with her face blurred, recounting some of what she saw.\n\nYura Karol, a 22-year-old security consultant, said he was hiding in the same spot, and he can be seen in one of Sapir’s photos. He and Sapir were part of a group of friends who had met up at the party. In an interview, Mr. Karol said he barely lifted his head to look at the road but he also described seeing a woman raped and killed.\n\nSince that day, Sapir said, she has struggled with a painful rash that spread across her torso, and she can barely sleep, waking up at night, heart pounding, covered in sweat.\n\n“That day, I became an animal,” she said. “I was emotionally detached, sharp, just the adrenaline of survival. I looked at all this as if I was photographing them with my eyes, not forgetting any detail. I told myself: I should remember everything.”\n\nhttps://t.co/aCTA8Kin1Y"
