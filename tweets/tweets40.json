        "text": "HonestReporting Responds to Attacks on Its \"Beyond Borders\" Exposé\n\nHonestReporting stands behind the legitimate questions we raised to media outlets in our recent exposé. The answers we received only raised more questions that have yet to be responded to. Why did the AP and CNN continue to work with Hassan Eslaiah despite his prior public picture and affection for Yahya Sinwar, mastermind of the October 7 Hamas massacre? Did the New York Times fact check Yousef Masoud when he explained that he was able to document the October 7 massacre in real time because rockets woke him at 5:30am, despite the rocket fire not beginning until 6:30am?\n\nRather than accusing AP, Reuters, CNN, or the NY Times of having advanced knowledge of the massacre, HonestReporting raised several questions related to the facts and ethics connected to the freelancers that accompanied an internationally-recognized terrorist organization on a cross border raid to rape, pillage, murder, and abduct Israeli civilians.\n\nThese outlets chose to attack HonestReporting’s intentions and credibility, despite the AP and CNN cutting ties with Eslaiah after our exposé. They accused HonestReporting of putting journalists at risk due to “baseless speculation” and lack of evidence.\n\nLet us be clear. Photojournalists being in the “right place at the right time” to document a surprise murderous attack on a random Saturday morning is enough to raise questions. And, as more evidence comes to light, it only supports our original questioning.\n\nExecutive Director Gil Hoffman’s subsequent conversations with Reuters and AP were misconstrued and taken out of context in an attempt to discredit our original exposé. To avoid the uncomfortable question of their freelancers’ activity on October 7, the media tried to reframe the conversation. They denied having advanced knowledge of the attack (which we did not claim), and then accused HonestReporting of spreading misinformation. We wholeheartedly reject this baseless assertion. HonestReporting noticed the details and asked the questions that fact checkers and editors at these news organizations should have done themselves.\n\nIsraeli and American government officials have used the questions raised in our article to push investigations. HonestReporting does not take direction from any government, nor they from us. Mr. Hoffman regrets commenting on the response of the Israeli government.\n\nWe are proud of the role that we play in holding the media accountable. How journalists frame events in and about Israel affect the safety of Jews worldwide; so we will continue to ensure that anti-Israel bias in mainstream media is exposed.\n\nHonestReporting believes that people deserve to have reliable news sources, whether it be in traditional or social media. So long as media continue to employ stringers who operate in an environment controlled by Hamas, without disclosing that Hamas is a totalitarian government that controls the flow of information from Gaza, they are providing a disservice to their readers. News outlets have a responsibility to ensure that they are not simply publishing Hamas propaganda. Transparency is the key to a healthy press."

It is intended as a final warning to tell civilians to get out of the building.\n\nUnfortunately, war is a horrible thing; and no matter how hard a country tries, innocents are always killed in every war. \n\nIsrael did not want this war, but Israel has the right under international law to self-defense after it suffered the worst terrorist attack in its history on October 7 by the #Hamas terrorist group that actually runs (with an iron fist) the entirety of the Gaza Strip.\n\nI will cover what exactly \"self-defense\" means and the limits of self-defense under international law in an upcoming tweet.\n\n#Education #Israel #Palestine"

He raised money for one of the most hateful, sexist, bigoted Muslim organizations in the nation. \n\nCAIR preaches civil liberties and won’t even defend the right of a Muslim woman to walk through the front door of a mosque. Greenwald’s support of CAIR gave them cover to do their dirty work, including campaign for the destruction of the state of Israel. \n\nNow, his arrogance supporting the racist hate group @NationalSJP is classic Glenn Greenwald. Self-righteous and condescending. \n\nColumbia University has made the CORRECT decision banning Students for Justice in Palestine — a hate group established by Hate ‘em @HatemBazian to terrorize Jewish students. \n\nI have always wanted to know: How much money have you gotten from @CAIRNational over the years, @ggreenwald? \n\n⬇️ See the many times Greenwald has shielded CAIR and its offshoots, like he does today. He tries to invoke moral congruence to defend hate speech. Calls for violence and genocide are NOT protected speech. \n\nGlenn Greenwald is not to be trusted or respected on the issue of protecting Jews or the state of Israel from Islamist hate groups. His arrogant defense of these hate groups must be rejected."

        "text": "Hi, I’m a lawyer. Do want to know what is really meant by a “#proportionate response” under international law? Then read on - and feel free to ask questions!\n\nUnder International Humanitarian Law, #proportionality requires that any degree of damage (up to and including death) to #civilians not be “excessive” in relation to the “military advantage anticipated from a strike against a military target.”\n\nWe are going to break that down, so everyone understands what exactly that means.\n\nHowever, first, you should be aware that it is a misnomer that anytime #Palestinian civilians die after an #Israeli strike, it is automatically evidence of an Israeli war crime. This is completely false - the law does not work that way.\n\nSimply, and unfortunately, the international rules of law recognize that civilians are often killed during war; and, most of the time, those deaths are actually not indicative of a war crime.\n\nInstead, the legal test for “proportionality” requires that each individual strike be looked at with a particular balancing analysis.\n\nFirst, here is a hard and fast rule: the strike must be intended to target a military objective; it is, therefore, an unlawful war crime to strike with the intent of targeting civilians without any military objective whatsoever.\n\nNow, let’s get a little technical while still keeping it simple.\n\nUnder the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions of 1977 at both Article 51(5)(b) and Article 52(2), we know that when #Hamas uses its own population (or Israeli #hostages) as #humanshields - either by using them to shield themselves or to shield their weapons depots - Hamas has, under international law, turned civilians targets into military targets.\n\nThat means that when Hamas places weapons caches in and under schools, hospitals, mosques, etc., Hamas has made each of those places legitimate military targets.\n\nSo, it has been well-known for many years that Hamas purposefully placed its headquarters underground beneath the al-Shifa Hospital. In doing so, international law holds that the hospital is no longer just a civilian target, it is a legitimate military target.\n\nThat does not necessarily give the IDF carte blanche to attack hospitals, schools, mosques, etc.; however, it does mean that an IDF attack on a civilian target that has been made into a military target by Hamas’ use of human shields is not per se illegal under international law.\n\nInstead, such a strike (as is the case with any strike conducted by a military like the IDF), must be analyzed through a balancing test.\n\nOne part of this balancing test performed by Israel before each strike is to determine whether the human shields in question are being used voluntarily or involuntarily.\n\nIf the human shields are being used voluntarily - meaning the human shields are there protecting Hamas and its weapons of their own volition - then the target remains a completely legitimate military target.\n\nIf the human shields are being used involuntarily - meaning Hamas is forcing people to act as human shields to protect themselves and/or their weapons - then the IDF must go back to the balancing test to determine whether the anticipated military advantage of a successful strike would outweigh the reasonably anticipated loss of civilian life.\n\nImportantly, the IDF rules state that if it cannot determine whether a human shield is being used voluntarily or involuntarily, it must presume the civilian is being used against his or her own will and treat the civilians as an involuntary participant.\n\nAssuming that there is a military target & that there may be human shields that are there involuntarily, the next step in the proportionality analysis for each individual strike (remember, proportionality is determined on a strike-by-strike basis, and not as the accumulation of strikes over time) is to try to determine the likely amount of damage to civilian persons and/or property as a result of the strike.\n\nIn other words, under international law, Israel must be able to give a sort of “value” to the anticipated impact on civilians (including potential civilian deaths). Simply, a smaller number of anticipated civilian casualties may make the strike proportionate if there is a significant military advantage to be gained by conducting the strike.\n\nHowever, if Israel determines that the anticipated impact of a strike may cause many civilian casualties, it must make the difficult determination of whether the anticipated military advantage is so significant that it warrants carrying out the strike anyway.\n\nSo, if Hamas has a weapons depot underneath a house with two civilians inside, and that house has been used to fire 500 rockets at Israeli civilians, and it is reasonably expected that there are hundreds more rockets under that house, Israel can almost certainly carry out the strike within the confines of international law.\n\nIf that same house, however, had 10 families living inside, including many children, it could - and likely would - tip the scales of the proportionality balancing test toward Israel not being permitted to carry out the strike, even though the house has been used to attack Israeli civilians and can be expected to continue to be used to carry out attacks against Israeli civilians.\n\nNow, that balancing test can always change. If that same house is being used to fire long-range, precision-guided missiles at Israel’s major population centers in places like #TelAviv (effectively putting millions of Israeli civilians in danger), the balancing test may tip back in favor of Israel being legally permitted to carry out the strike.\n\nThis all suggests the third and final step in the proportionality balancing test: the #IDF must determine and place a “value” on the anticipated military advantage that would be gained if it were to carry out a particular strike.\n\nAn attack on Hamas leadership and/or its weapons manufacturers would be considered a high value target. An attack on a single Hamas member who has no special skill, would be a much lower value military target.\n\nSimilarly, an attack on a small cache of mortars would have less military value that an attack on a large cache of advanced rockets that can reach large Israeli civilian population centers.\n\nOnce the @IDF determines the anticipated “value” of the likely effect on civilian persons and property and the anticipated “value” of the likely military advantage to be gained if the strike is carried out, the balancing test can be performed, and a certain amount of judgment must go into the determination of whether that strike would or would not be “proportionate.”\n\nImportantly, this decision is so vital that the IDF does not simply permit a single solder on the ground with his or her hand on the proverbial (or actual) “trigger” to make that determination.\n\nIn fact, the decision of whether a strike is proportionate is not even left up to IDF officers. It’s not even left up to IDF Generals.\n\nInstead, before any IDF strike can take place, IDF Guidelines provide that the proportionality balancing test must be presented to and analyzed by IDF military lawyers who then determine whether the strike is legally permissible as “proportionate” under international law and the rules of war.\n\nAnd these IDF military lawyers are not mere patsies or people who simply “rubber stamp” what the IDF requests.\n\nIn fact, the IDF’s military lawyers work entirely independently of the IDF. They are outside of the chain of command and do not answer to anyone in the IDF, including a General (for example).\n\nPlus, every IDF military lawyer knows he or she may very well be held to account if he or she makes a wrong decision based on the evidence available at the time.\n\nFurthermore, sometimes the decisions to be made while balancing the likely military advantage against the likely civilian casualties can be so difficult that the legality of the strike is first brought to the Israeli Supreme Court for instant review.\n\nAnother important concept: the comparison of civilian body counts of #Israelis versus #Palestinians (to the extent those numbers can be trusted since they come directly from Hamas-only) is not relevant to a proportionality analysis. Each strike must be viewed individually to determine proportionality. It is not a test of the cumulative nature of the strikes.\n\nAlso, by simply comparing body counts, it does not factor in how many people killed were actually #HamasTerrorists, how many were Hamas collaborators there voluntarily, and it does not consider what military advantage was gained by Israel carrying out any individual strike.\n\nAs Israel is now in the process of seeking to secure the military advantage of preventing Hamas from having the capacity to carry out repeated attacks of the kind and nature seen on October 7th, Israel is permitted to act proportionately insofar as necessary to achieve that military objective (the elimination of Hamas and/or its ability to make war).\n\nOne more important fact people do not know, but that they should know: according to UN statistics of global conflict, the average civilian to combatant killed ratio is a rather appalling nine civilians killed for every one combatant killed.\n\nThat’s why civilian body counts in and of themselves are never indicative of a war crime. Each individual strike has to be analyzed, and unfortunately civilians always suffer disproportionately in wars.\n\nIn fact, while Israel is routinely criticized for any of its strikes that kill civilians, you may be surprised to know that Israel’s civilian to combatant ratio is routinely much lower than the nine to one average.\n\nIn the very last operation carried out by the IDF prior to October 7 (in Jenin), 0.6 civilians were killed for every one combatant killed.\n\nIn that conflict, not only were the IDF’s ratio numbers nowhere near the nine to one international average, but the IDF actually managed to kill more combatants than civilians - something that is extremely rare.\n\nIn truth, Israel is targeted by accusations of war crimes almost immediately by the media, by politicians, and by the UN General Assembly despite the fact that those accusations are near 100% of the time based neither in fact nor in law.\n\nSince a proportionality balancing test must be used to determine whether a single specific Israeli strike falls within the confines of international law, someone providing an analysis must have all of the facts Israel considered before carrying out that strike as to the anticipated impact on civilians and the anticipated military advantage. Obviously, anyone who is making a snap judgment critical of Israel could not possibly have that information.\n\nUnderstand then, that when you see talking heads accusing Israel of “war crimes” immediately after and/or during Israeli strikes, that is not an actual legal analysis under international law of what constitutes a war crime.\n\nMuch more likely, what you are witnessing is part of Hamas’ ongoing psychological and propaganda warfare campaign of demonizing and delegitimizing the State of Israel in the eyes of public opinion.\n\n#Hamas_is_ISIS #HamasisISIS #HamasISIS #HamasMonsters #October7massacre"

We then smeared Vaseline all over to deter people from ripping them down,” a student leader explained. \n\nIn a chalk-permitted area, students wrote the following messages: \"There was a ceasefire on October 6\"\n\"Stand here if you support terrorism\" in the meeting area for the anti-Israel march.\n\n\"Walk this way if you are a Zionist\" where protesters are presumed to march.\n\"Love hummus, not Hamas\"\n\"Free Gaza from Hamas\"\n\"HaMASS MURDERS\"- *pictured below* the only chalk not wiped away because it is in the street- on the crosswalk. This morning, a student arrived at the chalking location and saw Tulane Cleaning Services hosing down the pavement. When asked why, they received orders from \"higher ups\" to remove SSI at Tulane’s chalking.\n\n\"Palestinians killed in Gaza,\" followed by names, written by pro-Hamas students are still up.\nThe cleaning staff ONLY erased the part added by SSI students: \"by Hamas.\" \n\nStudents met with administration who referred to the pro-Israel chalk as, “political.” \n\nStudents argued that it is not acceptable to erase only the chalk created by Israel-supporting students and allow the chalk of the opposing narrative. \n\nThe administrative representative noted that the school would continue to hose off the students’ chalk, and recommended that they consider how much time they put into chalking. As this newsletter is being typed, students are witnessing administration removing the posters of hostages…\nTulane University administration is eager to silence the pro-Israel voices on campus.\n\nLet Tulane University know that this blatent bias is UNACCEPTABLE: contact the office of the President https://t.co/M4RZVfq16f"
