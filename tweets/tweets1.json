Two of the men on the truck have their faces covered; the one in the front is holding a baton but is not¬†wearing any kind of uniform.\n\nI first saw this photo in a Daily Mail article by @dpatrikarakos. The source is the Rafah police department's Facebook page. The photo was uploaded there on January 10, 2024.\n\nI have so many questions.\n\nDoes UNRWA have a formal contract with Hamas for this protection, or is the arrangement more of a handshake deal? Is it normal that Hamas guys wear civilian clothes and cover their faces when dealing with humanitarian aid? Is it safe to assume that Hamas takes some of the aid for its fighters? Will Israeli hostages in Gaza receive any of the aid? How much of the aid is hoarded and sold for high prices? How much fuel did Hamas take from the fuel truck that is visible inside the compound?\n\nI also like the question that David Patrikarakos asked in his article: \"Even if UNRWA does not officially work with Hamas, but needs local security forces who answer to it to guard aid deliveries, how can it be sure that aid is distributed to refugees and not according to Hamas interests?\"\n\nI like to explain it this way: Everyone knows that UNRWA employs \"locals\" in Gaza. Who do you think the locals are?",

I am proud to be a Bedouin that served in the IDF as a combat soldier. I was blessed to have a meaningful service that I will never forget. During my service I discovered my strength and capabilities, and how I can deal with challenges, and I met amazing people who are friends for life.\n\nI'm happy to be able to connect betweeen cultures. I can invite my friends to have meat and Maqluba in Rahat, and I can come to the garden in the Kibbutz where they play guitar and sing Hebrew songs. I am happiest when I can travel the country with my friends and when I teach them Arabic and they try to speak with me and ask for help.\n\nDuring the war we have fallen soldiers who are Bedouin, Druze, Muslims abd Christians - they died heroes protecting our country.\n\nI want to awaken everybody reading this: we all share the same fate and we must be united. Unfortunately there are people who don't believe we should be and are trying to scare and break the trust - do not let them.\""

You invited their advice and this time a demand that is harming our soldiers. \n\nIsrael won every war since the war of independence - because we know and recognize our enemy. Unfortunately, the US has lost every war since WWII because they failed to recognize the enemy of who they are. \n\nThe US demanded Israel to avoid airstrikes unless its a clear & present danger. In other words, the enemy has to engage first for Israel to call in an airstrike. It is unacceptable and time to revert back to flattening a terror structure first by air and then ground to clear the remaining trash. \n\nThe existence of Israel cannot and should not depend on the elections in the US and votes in Michigan. \n\nShare and repost."

My family moved from Lebanon because the Arab Muslims made our lives hell and would frequently attack and kill us in the village nevertheless one by one. \n\nThey had lived in Lebanon for almost 300 years and before that, they lived in southern Iraq‚Ä¶ for over 1300 years. That‚Äôs right, since before Islam even existed. We have been there since the time of the elder religions. You know, the ones that were all over the region from Persia to Iraq and Syria and all the way down to Yemen and even North Africa. Like the Zoroastrians. \n\nThe Arab Jews didn‚Äôt get turned by the Ashkenazi. They got turned by the constant bloody pogroms the Arab Muslims would inflict on Arab Jews every single decade‚Ä¶ for 1300 fucking years. \n\nThey murdered so many of our people, tortured them, and burned them‚Ä¶ pretty much Oct 7 twice per generation, for 1300 years. And when we had the opportunity and just didn‚Äôt want to be completely wiped out like a dozen other entire populations, the Muslims genocided or forced to convert, we fled. And we fled and fled and fled until we realized we could find a safe haven in the land that 2000 years was ours to start with before any of the Muslims ever existed. \n\nMy family arrived during the Ottoman Empire and we lived in somewhat subjugation but still were left in peace. We built new villages and towns around our ancestral temple in Jerusalem. We started to buy swathes of land up and down the country. \n\nThen, one day, Muslims best and closest friends in Germany, the Nazis, decided to come on over and teach them all-new ways to kill us. And they wanted no time trying out their new death tricks. Then Mufti went over to have lunch with Hitler and boom‚Ä¶ we were fucked and he killed 6 million of us across Europe. \n\nWhen those who survived came over because they‚Äôd heard the British were giving the land they now ruled to the Jews, the Arab Muslims were not happy. Why? Because as they did for 1300 years before, they wanted it all and wanted us dead. So they attacked in pogroms for 20 years until we finally had enough and fought back, even against the British who let them kill us. \n\nAnd finally, in 1948, we declared independence, and Muslims declared genocidal war on us, after just one damned day. Just before that war of 48, Muslim armies demanded all the Arabs on the land to leave so that they could kill every single Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jew alike. The majority of Muslims left Israel so we could be killed, and we ended up kicking their asses and winning the war. The Nakba wasn‚Äôt their Nakba. It was ours. They betrayed us, not the other way around. My family was there when they did it. \n\nAnd then for the last 76 years, Muslims have been crying that they want the land back. Well, erm, NO!!! It‚Äôs not their land, and it never was. Muslims were all stuck in a cage in Gaza but Israel didn‚Äôt control Gaza then. Egypt did. And Muslims know what? They didn‚Äôt complain once. Then they attacked us in 1967 to slaughter us all, again, and we won, again. But this time we conquered Gaza and what‚Äôs now the West Bank.\"\n\n~ @CherylE59628",

It‚Äôs Muslims who have a culture and religious duty to demolish other people‚Äôs places of worship and build mosques on top of them. The only problem with that approach is that you can only do it when you have power. When others regain power, they reclaim their places of worship and leave you in tears."

Shani did not know that in those minutes thousands of armed terrorists infiltrated the festival area. Near road 232 there were mortar shells falling, Shani and her friends were directed to enter the shelter on the side of the road. They immediately did so, only they had no idea that in a few minutes, they would go through hell. When they went inside, terrorists arrived and started throwing grenades at them inside the shelter. Shani and her friends repelled the first grenades and when they already thought the nightmare was over, the terrorists sprayed them with gunfire. At a certain point the terrorists stopped the shooting and pulled out those who remained alive. The terrorists grabbed Shani and her roommate who came with her to the party and dragged them wounded and bleeding into the van. Shani came to the festival to celebrate the role she got in a new job she was accepted to. After long days of searching, uncertainty and endless worry, the family received the bitter news.  The terrorists murdered her and her roommate in a van on the way to Gaza with unimaginable cruelty. Imagine this, being held captive in a two meter shelter, surviving a grenade attack and close range shooting, being injured, kidnapped and then brutally murdered along the way. Imagine the last moments of Shani, who had a whole life ahead of her, and especially many dreams that she would never fulfill. Rest in peace Beautiful Girl, no one will hurt you anymore."

The news anchor interrupts her to ask about this horrible news. Nicole says that the numbers are unconfirmed\nThis is probably hearsay as news were traveling between first responders from several sites\n\nNowhere you'll find anyone claiming there were 40 decapitated babies\n\nThe anti Israeli propaganda put these two claims together and started immediately accusing Israel of lies\n\nIn reality, in Kfar Aza the youngest victim was a 14 year old boy. In total 52 people were brutally murdered and many kidnapped\n\nThe story took off when NBC news called reports of \"40 beheaded babies\" unverified allegations\n\nThat's how it works:\n- Invent something based on half truths and unconfirmed nameless testimonies\n- blame Israel for making a false claim and ask to prove it\n- share ad infinitum to show Israel is lying",

Just be grateful that the coalition government has the courage to make the decisions in the face of such pressure and adversity. Don‚Äôt let your reservations undermine Israel. Doing so allows the cancer of anti-Israel and antisemitism to grow. \n\nStand firm and stand with Israel; your Jewish family across the diaspora will be standing with you.\n\n#AmYisraelChai\n#StandWithIsrael"

Two of the men on the truck have their faces covered; the one in the front is holding a baton but is not¬†wearing any kind of uniform.\n\nI first saw this photo in a Daily Mail article by @dpatrikarakos. The source is the Rafah police department's Facebook page. The photo was uploaded there on January 10, 2024.\n\nI have so many questions.\n\nDoes UNRWA have a formal contract with Hamas for this protection, or is the arrangement more of a handshake deal? Is it normal that Hamas guys wear civilian clothes and cover their faces when dealing with humanitarian aid? Is it safe to assume that Hamas takes some of the aid for its fighters? Will Israeli hostages in Gaza receive any of the aid? How much of the aid is hoarded and sold for high prices? How much fuel did Hamas take from the fuel truck that is visible inside the compound?\n\nI also like the question that David Patrikarakos asked in his article: \"Even if UNRWA does not officially work with Hamas, but needs local security forces who answer to it to guard aid deliveries, how can it be sure that aid is distributed to refugees and not according to Hamas interests?\"\n\nI like to explain it this way: Everyone knows that UNRWA employs \"locals\" in Gaza. Who do you think the locals are?",

          "text": "When UN teachers praise Hamas terror\n\nGermany's Die @Welt |  January 19, 2024\nBy @clemenswergin\nChief Foreign Policy Correspondent\n\nWasim Ula is a teacher employed by UNRWA. In a Telegram chat he runs for the UN refugee agency's teachers, Ula celebrates the terrorist organization Hamas, according to research by the non-governmental organization UN Watch.\n\nIn the chat, he calls for Israelis to be killed. And distributes Hamas propaganda videos with the line: \"May God protect them\", only to dryly inform in the next sentence that UNRWA salaries would be paid from Sunday. He then goes on to post a picture of an explosive vest and comments: \"Just wait, sons of Judaism.\"\n\nCritics of the United Nations have been saying for years that UN institutions in Gaza have been infiltrated by Hamas, especially the Palestinian refugee relief organization UNRWA. There is now further serious evidence to support this claim.\n\nUN Watch has discovered and analyzed a Telegram chat group of UNRWA teachers. According to the research, the group's administrators and regular members glorify the terrorist acts of Hamas. The Arabic-language group is said to include 3,000 UNRWA teachers.\n\nUN Watch has made it its mission to expose the infiltration of the United Nations by authoritarian and dictatorial regimes, as well as the anti-Israeli bias of UN institutions. Since 2015, UN Watch has exposed more than 150 UNRWA employees who have expressed sympathy for the terrorist organization Hamas on social media.\n\nHowever, the latest discovery has a whole new dimension: 3000 UNRWA teachers are no longer just a small minority, but a significant proportion of employees in Gaza and elsewhere.\n\nUN does not react\n\nAccording to UN Watch, it initially made the material available to the United Nations and asked them to recognize that UN employees were praising acts of terrorism. There was no official response. A spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres was asked about the chat group at a press conference.\n\n\"I think UN Watch has a track record and that speaks for itself, from our perspective,\" the spokesman said in an attempt to discredit the NGO. \"But of course all allegations will be investigated.\" In an interview with an Israeli TV station, UNRWA representative Adnan Hasna does not want to know anything. \"We don't know who is in this Telegram group,\" he said, and it is also not known whether these people actually work for UNRWA.\n\nIn fact, the examples presented by UN Watch from the chat group are deeply disturbing and often easy to attribute. UN Watch head Hillel Neuer published some of the posts - including the UNRWA ID of each person. It is a surreal mixture of normal teacher chats and anti-Semitic hate propaganda.\n\nMemos from the head of UNRWA in Gaza, Thomas White, are posted as well as information about teaching materials, teacher lists and digital courses. And in between, terror attacks are repeatedly praised. UNRWA teachers reacted with enthusiasm immediately after the Hamas massacre of Israeli civilians began. There is Morid Issa, for example, who calls Jews \"monkeys\" and celebrates the fact that the Hamas massacre on October 7 exceeded expectations.\n\nOthers, such as administrator Safaa al-Najar, praise the Hamas terrorists as \"holy warriors\" and post videos of the massacre.\n\nAnother UNRWA teacher, Abdallah Mehjez, says that civilians should not follow the Israeli military's call to leave the combat zones - which at the time of the post reflects the official Hamas position, whose interest is not to lose its human shields in the contested areas.\n\nIn light of this research, the question of whether UNRWA and other UN institutions in Gaza have been infiltrated or even co-opted by Hamas is increasingly being raised. UNRWA represents a significant economic factor for Gaza because, according to its statute, refugee status is passed on from generation to generation and UNRWA therefore remains responsible for the descendants of those who were displaced in the first Arab-Israeli war in 1949.\n\nUN employs more people in Gaza than in New York\n\n\"UNRWA employs more than 12,000 local Palestinians in Gaza and its facilities in the territory include 245 schools with more than 230,000 students, 22 primary health care centers and many centers for women, community outreach and vocational training,\" writes Claudia Rosett of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nIn Gaza alone, the UN employs more people than in New York or Geneva, the organization's headquarters. In total, more than 30,000 people in the region are employed by UNRWA.\n\nThe inherited refugee status of the Palestinians and the high birth rates ensure that the organization is responsible for more and more people. The number of Palestinian \"refugees\" for whom UNRWA claims responsibility has grown from 700,000 at the end of the 1940s to more than 5.4 million today.\n\nIn fact, there are significantly more people working for the refugee aid organization created just for the Palestinians than for the UNHCR, which is responsible for all other refugees in the world and only pays around 17,000 employees. UNRWA also spends more than twice as much money per refugee as the UNHCR.\n\nIn the past, UNRWA has been criticized, among other things, because its textbooks spread antisemitic content, demonize Israel and praise \"martyrdom\", i.e. the armed struggle against Israel. And even in the current conflict, UNRWA and other UN institutions have often disseminated unchecked Hamas claims.\n\nIn fact, the question now arises as to whether UNRWA's proximity to Hamas is to blame for the fact that the interests of the Palestinian population are being ignored where they conflict with Hamas' goals. For example, UNRWA has never clearly condemned the terrorist organization for using Palestinian civilians as human shields or criticized the fact that Hamas has demonstrably misused UNRWA schools as weapons depots, weapons production sites and launching pads for rocket launchers, including schools that are directly co-financed by Germany.\n\nUNRWA also constantly complains that Israel is not doing enough to deliver aid to Gaza - but remains silent about the fact that aid convoys are routinely hijacked by armed Hamas extremists. There are now numerous accusations from Palestinians that Hamas then sells the aid deliveries on to the population - at exorbitant prices.\n\nThis is also being deliberately ignored by UNRWA. \"In practice, UNRWA is now so deeply involved in affairs in Gaza that it effectively functions as a support service for Hamas,\" says FDD expert Rosett. It is also significant that, despite overwhelming evidence, neither UNRWA nor the WHO have yet clearly condemned the misuse of hospitals by Hamas as military operation centers.\n\nEven the children are indoctrinated\n\nAnd although UNRWA schools play a central role in the education of the young generation in Gaza, the organization has never clearly opposed Hamas' militarization of Palestinian childhood in recent years. For many years, Hamas and other terrorist militias have been running summer camps in which young people are turned into child soldiers. According to experts from the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, around 100,000 children took part in Hamas' military summer camps last summer.\n\nIn some cases, the militarization of Palestinians begins in kindergarten. In 2018, the Jerusalem Institute of Justice therefore called on the International Criminal Court in a report to initiate investigations against Hamas leader Ismail Haniya for war crimes against Palestinian children.\n\nFor experts, it is no surprise that the school system in Gaza, including that of UNRWA, is infiltrated by Hamas. \"When Hamas came to power in 2007, it saw a golden opportunity to have open access to funding and the school system to indoctrinate children from a young age,\" Michael Barak of the Reichman University Counter-Terrorism Center in Herzliya told The Jerusalem Post.\n\nThe exposed UNRWA teachers are also not just \"a few negative individual cases, as UNRWA claims\", says Dina Rovner from UN Watch. The Telegram group shows \"what UNRWA teachers think when they believe that no one is watching. They openly support Hamas terrorism, they glorify terrorists as 'martyrs' and 'heroes' and they believe it's a wonderful path for Palestinian children to follow.\"\n\nThe strength of Hamas' influence on the UN sub-organization was already apparent in 2021. Back then, Hamas had declared the German UNRWA director in Gaza, Matthias Schmale, persona non grata because he did not toe its line. Schmale was subsequently withdrawn from Gaza by the UN.\n\nhttps://t.co/kdYylKxEts"

Aside from the multiple offers for an official state, Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005 and gave the Palestinians the keys.\n\nPalestinians elected a self-proclaimed terrorist group as their government. Instead of building a Western-recognizable state, they created terror infrastructure in every mosque and school, built hundreds of underground tunnels for the terrorists, and composed a murderous manifesto.\n\nThen, they killed a bunch of their neighbors and their kids and then kidnapped 240 others.\n\nSo maybe the Palestinians aren‚Äôt interested in an official ‚Äústate‚Äù as you see it. Maybe their intentions and desires aren‚Äôt ones the Western world can really understand through a displaced sympathy tweet."
