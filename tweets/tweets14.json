        "text": "A couple of points on claims regarding the supposed uniqueness and barbarity of Israel's war in Gaza, using Russia's mass crimes at Mariupol as a comparitive example:\n\n1. Mariupol had a pre-war population of less than a quarter of that of the Gaza strip;\n\n2. Gaza's death toll, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry, reached 20k today. Assuming that number is accurate AND is all civilians (which would require us assuming 0 Hamas fighters have died, a dubious claim), based on population the death toll in Mariupol (est. between 25k and 75k by observers) would be anywhere from more that 4x to more than 12x that of Gaza. If we take Israel's figure that 8k of the dead are fighters, than the per capita civilian death toll in Mariupol would be from ~8x to ~24x higher than in Gaza;\n\n3. Mariupol didn't have military infrastructure embedded throughout and underneath the civilian population, meaning that the bombing of the civilian population by Russia was unnecessary militarily and therefore was a purposeful act of mass murder. Questions of discriminancy and proportionality aside, it cannot be said that there is no military purpose to Israel's bombing campaign in the dense urban parts of Gaza, as the integration of military and civilian infrastructure in Gaza is well-documented and pervasive. In Gaza, the placement of infrastructure by Hamas among civilians (which is a war crime) is intended to deter Israeli military action by producing conditions in which a large civilian death tolls is unavoidable in any operation to uproot Hamas. This muddles any discussion of proportionality, as the risks to Israeli troops on the ground in Gaza without a significant aerial campaign would be staggering, thereby changing the calculus regarding what constitutes a proportional strike in balancing risk to civilians to military necessity. No military would take that kind of risk, and frankly the operational risks Israel is tolerating in order to minimize civilian deaths (telegraphing strikes, providing windows of opportunity to flee, and putting troops on the ground where other forces would simply strike from the sky) is almost unheard of elsewhere;\n\n4. Israel has legitimate casus belli to go after Hamas by any reading of international law, whereas Russia's naked aggression in Ukraine had no such military justification and is therefore illegal under int'l law. Ergo, *every* death caused by Russia is ipso facto criminal in a way that deaths caused by Israeli are not.\n\n5. We have no way of verifying the actor responsible for all deaths in Gaza. It is reasonable to assume that the vast majority were caused by Israeli actions, but we know that around 25% of Hamas/PIJ rockets fall short. To take a dramatic example, when the al Ahli hospital compound was struck in October, Hamas claimed between 500 to 800 civilians were killed; it was later demonstrated conclusively that the cause was a PIJ misfire, not an Israeli strike. Estimates of dead have since been reduced considerably since this fact emerged to perhaps several dozens of civilians killed, but either way this constituted among the deadliest single-location strikes of the war. If Hamas's initial estimate were true, than 2.5% to 5% of the current civilian death toll was caused by PIJ in one strike on al Ahli. It stands to reason that there are many more such cases, and given the fact that there can't be warnings given to civilians as to where misfires will land it is likely there are a considerable number of deaths caused by such incidents. The game-playing regarding the al Ahli death toll also puts further into doubt the reliability and authenticity of Hamas health ministry claims. (continued below) 1/2"

With a starting bias. The fact is that Israel is following the laws of war and no military in the world has faced the context Israel faces today.\n\nNo military in the world has fought a war against a military of 30,000 plus fighters  (defenders) embedded in underground cities purposely interwoven into the dense civilian population and protected sites under the framework of the modern laws of international armed conflict while their (the attackers) cities are being indiscriminately bombed on a daily basis from the enemy violating all modern laws of war and with a strategy and practice of getting their own civilians killed as a method of warfare for the purpose of hoping (based on precedence) the greater world will stop the law abiding attackers.\n\nA few large inaccuracies of the ‚Äúmost destructive in history‚Äù -\n\n- Including battles against one city in modern history to all cities in Gaza that Israel is attacking Hamas in.\n\n- Battle of Mariupol indiscriminate bombing to Gaza discriminate bombing, and not comparing civilian deaths where in Mariupol the number of dead to include in the large mass graves seen by satellite is vastly unknown from 25,000 to as great as 75,000.\n\n- Cherry picking World War II bombing data or including not bombed cities in Germany with bombed cities to get a favorable statistic.\n\nIsrael is following the laws of war in a context no military in war has ever faced."

Because I am not a sick bastard who wants to watch women suffer, nor do I believe that an entire nation and tens of thousands of people would just lie about their women being raped.\n\nBut, when it comes to us Jews, all we got is accusations of lying even though HAMAS documented and broadcasted their crimes. The most disheartening thing about this is that the accusations came from educated Westerners here in the UK and across the world. \n\nI never thought I would live to see anything even remotely like this. This is industrial-scale hatred. This is what led to the Holocaust. If we didn't fight back, you would have been rounding us up and sending us to concentration camps. This is coming from a guy who before Oct 7th believed that nothing like the Holocaust would ever happen again!"
