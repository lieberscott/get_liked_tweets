        "text": "Have you heard of the “Hispanic Health Paradox”?\n\nIn the US, Hispanics are poorer than white Americans, are less likely to be insured, and have higher rates of obesity. Yet they live about two years longer on average! Researchers have tried to explain this fact but come up empty. Some have invented a just-so story in which Hispanics live longer because they have a “collectivist culture,” but this seems ad hoc. This wouldn’t explain why they have such high rates of diabetes and heart disease. Why would a collectivist culture protect you against death but not illness? Aren’t there many “collectivist cultures” that don’t have higher life expectancies?\n\nThere’s a good possibility that the causes here are genetic. Perhaps hybrid vigor? Or some kind of selection pressure brought on by the encounter with Europeans, that wiped out the majority of natives through disease? There are ways to investigate such questions, but most scholars don’t seem interested.\n\nOne interesting fact is that if you look at the relationship between GDP and life expectancy, Latin American countries have higher life expectancies than you would expect given their level of wealth, while African countries are lower. This matches the data in the US, where Hispanics live longer and blacks live shorter lives than the white majority. Researchers have noticed that the Hispanic health paradox exists outside the US too, but even then they don’t connect this fact to the possibility that it just might be genetic.\n\nSetting aside the causes of Hispanic life expectancy, I would bet that if you polled most Americans, they wouldn’t even guess that Hispanics live longer. We are bombarded with propaganda about how racism causes blacks to have higher rates of obesity, heart disease, infant mortality, death in childbirth, etc, and this is treated as settled science. But the Hispanic-white gap is met with a shrug.\n\nIt’s not hard to figure out why. Liberals are supposed to believe that disparities are caused by discrimination, and never by genetics. If there are biological reasons for Hispanics outliving whites, might there be similar reasons for whites outliving blacks? Even if we take an agnostic view on the white-Hispanic gap, just admitting that we are unsure about its causes is fatal for the left-wing view on race. As soon as elite institutions bring up the Hispanic-white gap and admit that it’s a mystery, people naturally ask how you can be so sure that whites have better health than blacks because of racism? Since racism has to be the cause of every white-black gap that favors whites, any information that might call that assumption into question gets ignored.\n\nOf course, I’m not saying there’s a conspiracy to suppress the Hispanic Health Paradox. That’s why I can cite journal articles and media reports about it. Racial liberalism usually doesn’t work by censoring the data or directly restricting what people can talk about. Rather, some facts are emphasized and made salient, and others are simply ignored. Some explanations are taken as likely true based on limited evidence, while scholars are more likely to admit ignorance when there isn’t political pressure to arrive at a conclusive answer. And some hypotheses are not even considered, as you’ll be much less likely to get grants or an academic job if you come to a politically incorrect conclusion.\n\nAlmost everything liberals say about race is a lie. If you haven’t heard of the Hispanic Health Paradox before, it’s good to keep in mind as yet another fact they need to ignore in order to hold on to their false worldview."

Romero, executive director of the ACLU. \"The devastating conflict in Israel and Palestine has embroiled campuses here at home, sometimes resulting in speech that includes terms we vehemently disagree with or even find offensive and repugnant. Yet it's precisely in times of crisis and fear that university leaders must remain firm in their commitment to free speech, open debate, and peaceful dissent on campus. A blanket call to investigate every chapter of a pro-Palestinian student group for 'material support to terrorists' — without even an attempt to cite evidence — is unwarranted, wrong, and dangerous. It echoes America's mistakes during the McCarthy era and is counterproductive. We urge college and university leaders to hold fast to our nation's best traditions and reject proposals to restrict constitutionally protected speech.\"\n\nRead our full letter here: https://t.co/YRg3QkgYBN"
