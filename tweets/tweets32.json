She was convicted of that crime and sentenced to 8.5 years. Elbagir baselessly declares it a miscarriage of justice. \n\nThe reason a condition for release is no open celebration is not because of a far-right minister many people dislike, but because it’s already hard enough for the victims of this terrorism and their families to watch the culprits being released. \n\nNotice @nimaelbagir is using this example of a convicted terrorist as evidence that the people being released aren’t terrorists, that Israel is unfairly demonizing them as such, and that Israel doesn’t differentiate between terrorists and civilians. \n\nReally gross and dishonest.",

And here Palestinians get their phones out to excitedly film the execution of another Palestinian at the hands of Hamas. Large sections of the Muslim world have also become toxified by Islamic fundamentalism. Those who support Hamas have become as toxic as Nazis. Those wicked, sneering cruel Islamist fanatics who will attack this tweet in the comments for speaking the truth - for calling out their rapist friends Hamas. The Islamic fundamentalist rape gang Hamas have turned Gaza into sociopathic society full of murderers and murderer wannabes. No one would want them as their neighbours. Arab countries certainly don’t. To all you simple, brain dead, rape and murder supporting religious fanatics - we are not scared of Islamist pussies. You need numbers because you are pussies. You need to act in a mob because you are pussies. You need to hunt in a pack because what you believe is an ideology of pussies. You are feral bullying scumbags who are the enemies of enlightenment and civilisation. You are theocratic barbarians who would bring the world back into the dark age. You are the most stupid people on planet earth. You offer nothing of value to anyone."

As I was searching for news about her, I found an article that was published a few days ago in one of Israel’s most popular magazines, ‘La Isha’. It is an account of the events on October 7th as told by Natalie Hand, Emily’s older sister.  One of the things that shocked me deeply was how Natalie and her Irish father, Tom Hand, were treated here on their recent visit to 🇮🇪.  Apparently a hotel reservation made for Natalie and Tom in Dublin was CANCELLED when it was found out that they are Israeli citizens.  Whoever is responsible for treating the Hand family in such a despicable, cruel and discriminatory manner must be held accountable‼️\nI have read through the entire article in its original Hebrew form…9 year old Emily Hand has had to endure not only the death of her birth mother from cancer, but now she has lost her second mother, Narkis, who was murdered by Hamas on October 7th. I urge all of you to read the article via Google translate (link attached). Keep in mind that there are some errors in translation, but you will get the gist of it.  Here is a short excerpt: “I called Emily again and made a video call with her. She told me she was scared. She told me: 'Natalie, there are terrorists in the kibbutz. They burn our houses. Natalie, I don't want to die.’”  \nMay little Emily & ALL the hostages being held by Hamas return home soon to their families 😪💔https://t.co/RI1G6Eej5s",
