On October 7th at 6 in the morning, the three friends met in their sports clothes, took a selfie for the running group and set off. After 4 kilometers a rocket barrage began, they took cover when suddenly they began to hear gunfire and shouts of \"Allah Akbar\" near them. They found a large pipe, approached it and covered themselves with leaves. Suddenly an armed terrorist ran towards them, a frightened Kobi started running, the terrorist shot at him and he fell. Within minutes, ten terrorists arrived on the scene and began looking for civilians to murder in their surroundings, imagine, for 5 hours the three lay on the ground when suddenly they heard IDF soldiers, \"We are civilians\" Ram signaled to them, but the soldiers could not rescue them from there and asked them to continue hiding. 2  Soldiers stayed behind to secure them and the others promised to return soon. Suddenly a loud gunshot was heard, and a shootout ensued, the terrorists threw grenades, all were wounded and fell to the ground. A terrorist arrived at the scene, the bleeding Kobi tried to run away again, a burst of gunfire rang out and Kobi screamed and fell. Another terrorist arrived at the scene He fired another burst, hitting Ram and immediately after that, hitting Naomi, who was next to him. Ram lay on his stomach, his face in the sand, his back covered in blood, and waited for his death. One of the wounded soldiers managed to shoot and eliminate the terrorists, but for Kobi and Naomi it was too late.
