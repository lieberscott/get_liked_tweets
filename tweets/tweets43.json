The way they pretend the ongoing conflict is one sided, ignoring the the thousands of rockets shot at Israeli cities constantly, hundreds of thousands of Israeli families that have left their homes and spend days in bomb sheltered, families still burying loved ones, hostages being kept by Hamas, young people now risking their lives to take on Hamas etc\n\nAnd even just with Gaza: They take the Hamas death toll as fact (a mistake), but then also frame all the deaths as Israeli responsibility. No differentiation between Hamas terrorists killed Vs civilians. No differentiation between the countless civilians killed by Hamas/IJ (20-30% of rockets fall in Gaza) vs in Israeli strikes. No acknowledgement of Hamas‚Äô responsibility in hiding among civilians (a war crime) and trying to prevent them from leaving the war zone. \n\nEvery single aspect of the framing is one-sided and then they use that framing to apply pressure on Israel to give Hamas an out."

What's the enthusiasm, exhilaration, for the Hamas brutal terrorist attack that happened on the 7th of October?\n\nFirst postcolonial discourse, which sees colonialism as an unforgivable sin, and stands for the rights of the oppressed to fight against the colonizers, sometimes even by use of terrorism. \n\nSecond, an inner critique of the west, a condemnation of western cultural domination, of globalization, of the American empire, and everything that connected to it.\n\nThird: post-nationalism, paradoxically enough the delegitimization of the rights of ethnic groups to self-determination. \n\nBut there's something else here: Antisemitism.\nIt is impossible to understand this expression by former member of parliament on behalf of the British labor, except as singling out the state of Israel, and undermining its right of existence. \n\nWhich other country in the world loses its right to exist because of war crimes? This is new antisemitism. Not only because it comes from the left, but because it sees the Jew not as a foreigner, or as other, as sub-human race, defiling the west, or threatening the existence of the Christian civilization. \n\nHere, Judaism is hated because it is very much western, because it lays at the root and the foundation of the west, because it exemplifies western values today, and because in unbelievably paradoxical turn of events, it is considered white.\n\nTheir hatred of Jews here is connected to the rejection of colonialism of the nationstate, of the western cultural dominance. \n\nAnd Israel today is seen as the epitome of all of these. The post-colonial vector in which the west is aiming to cleanse itself of its colonial past, to give deserved space to oppressed cultures, to minorities,  region indigenous people cannot but see Israel is as a stubborn remnant of its colonial past. But the right part is a convenient excuse for the wrong part. That is an undermining of Israel‚Äôs very right to exist.\nThe denial of the fundamental right of Jews for a nationstate of their own, and the very denial of Israel's right to exist serves itself as a rite of atonement and purification for the west 's old colonial sins.\nThe Jew is once again crucified for the sins of others,  sacrificed in order to cleanse the west of its old sins perhaps even of itself.\n\nBut, we're not your scapegoats. We're not your eternal alter egos. We're human, and we want to live:\nhttps://t.co/w11iBYSIxm"

Since October 7, 2023, I have been privy to a level of Jew-hatred that is difficult to fathom.  It comes from the progressive Left, from the ultra Right, and from Islamic sources.  Each group utilizes a different set of tropes but all share  diabolical, orgiastic, and hateful foaming of the evil Jew.  It is unrestrained all-consuming genocidal hate.  There is nothing that one can say that softens the hate.  Nothing that allows for a moment to pause.  Even if every one of the voices spewing these hateful positions were to fall silent, the cat is out of the bag.  You may think that you are untouched by these realities because you are not Jewish.  But please heed my warnings.  Those who are capable of such positions are not those whom you want to be leading our once enlightened societies.  We are all collectively going to pay an extraordinarily high price for the current realities.  I say this without any malice in my heart.  I share this because I want our grandchildren to have a better world than the one that we currently have.  My moral compass is not driven by tribalism.  It is solely shaped by a commitment to deontological ideals that have historically made the West the wondrous envy of all societies.  We are losing these ideals at a breathtaking pace.  The civilizational price is going to be incalculable.    I wish everyone a good night."

What's the enthusiasm, exhilaration, for the Hamas brutal terrorist attack that happened on the 7th of October?\n\nFirst postcolonial discourse, which sees colonialism as an unforgivable sin, and stands for the rights of the oppressed to fight against the colonizers, sometimes even by use of terrorism. \n\nSecond, an inner critique of the west, a condemnation of western cultural domination, of globalization, of the American empire, and everything that connected to it.\n\nThird: post-nationalism, paradoxically enough the delegitimization of the rights of ethnic groups to self-determination. \n\nBut there's something else here: Antisemitism.\nIt is impossible to understand this expression by former member of parliament on behalf of the British labor, except as singling out the state of Israel, and undermining its right of existence. \n\nWhich other country in the world loses its right to exist because of war crimes? This is new antisemitism. Not only because it comes from the left, but because it sees the Jew not as a foreigner, or as other, as sub-human race, defiling the west, or threatening the existence of the Christian civilization. \n\nHere, Judaism is hated because it is very much western, because it lays at the root and the foundation of the west, because it exemplifies western values today, and because in unbelievably paradoxical turn of events, it is considered white.\n\nTheir hatred of Jews here is connected to the rejection of colonialism of the nationstate, of the western cultural dominance. \n\nAnd Israel today is seen as the epitome of all of these. The post-colonial vector in which the west is aiming to cleanse itself of its colonial past, to give deserved space to oppressed cultures, to minorities,  region indigenous people cannot but see Israel is as a stubborn remnant of its colonial past. But the right part is a convenient excuse for the wrong part. That is an undermining of Israel‚Äôs very right to exist.\nThe denial of the fundamental right of Jews for a nationstate of their own, and the very denial of Israel's right to exist serves itself as a rite of atonement and purification for the west 's old colonial sins.\nThe Jew is once again crucified for the sins of others,  sacrificed in order to cleanse the west of its old sins perhaps even of itself.\n\nBut, we're not your scapegoats. We're not your eternal alter egos. We're human, and we want to live:\nhttps://t.co/w11iBYSIxm"
