What people refuse to acknowledge is that the main impediment to peace since 1947 has been the unwillingness of the Palestinian Arabs to accept a Jewish state in the area. They could have had a state repeatedly for over 75 years if they could have just accepted that reality. Instead they have only supported violence, which has gotten Palestinians one loss after the next and permanent refugee status without them recognizing the inevitability of the outcome. Although their leadership has gotten incredibly rich from that cycle.\n\nThe continued evidence that they will not accept the Jewish state only works against them. Their open support for Israel's destruction and continued war makes it impossible for Israel to accept an autonomous Palestinian state on their border from which those same Palestinians will continue to wage war. No one is going to reward 10/7 with greater concessions to Palestinians. That's not the lesson anyone in Israel is taking away. People elsewhere can whine about it all they want, but it's not their children who will be targeted for death as a result.\n\nThere is no path to peace, and certainly not 2 states, until Palestinians get leadership that openly tells their people that they must accept Israel's existence and violence won't change the reality of such a state. Not just in false sense of signing a piece of paper while planning more attacks, but really tell that to Palestinians. That won't happen until others force Palestinian leaders to take accountability for their actions instead of just treating them like victims with no agency. As long as they get rewarded for perpetuating the war, they will continue to do so and those encouraging it are complicit in a lack of resolution."

I am so sad that my body cannot contain the sorrow.\n\nI want to tell you that I will be strong and I will overcome and take care of the children, but the truth is, right now I don't know how I will do it.\n\nI want to tell you that you got to see our three amazing children and thank you for the gifts you left me. But God, they are so small you haven't seen them grow yet.\n\nI want to tell you that we had a full and perfect life and everything was so good. But it was so, so short.\n\nI want to tell you that we took advantage of every moment, but you were taken from us in your last two months.\n\nI want to tell you that you are a hero, but you didn't want to be a hero. You just wanted your life back.\n\nI didn't allow myself to be afraid, that maybe you really are not in a dangerous place like you said, I didn't allow myself to think that there was a chance that you wouldn't come back. \n\nWe promised the children! You promised to be at Ido's second grade Hanukkah party. He is still waiting for you to come back and we will celebrate his birthday together!\n\nIdo continues to ask that we look for a cure. It was difficult for him, but in the end he said that you are in our hearts, and that in the future we can be as happy as before you left.\n\nThis is the worst possible ending. I don't know how to continue from here. So even though right now it seems impossible to me, I promise to do everything everything to keep, protect and love the children from your heart as well."
