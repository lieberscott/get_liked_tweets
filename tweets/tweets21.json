I get that they want to be able to murder innocent Jews without the Jews fighting back, but that’s not how the world works anymore. Wars are very costly, even for the “winners”. They are sometimes necessary, but that’s why you don’t launch them without understanding the consequences. \n\nKeep that in mind when you see people even now cheering on “the resistance” and Israel’s destruction while simultaneously acting outraged over the victims of the war they supported. All they are doing is volunteering more people to die. And no, calling for a ceasefire so Hamas can re-arm and launch another attack isn’t the same as supporting peace."

Hamas surrendering means Israel wins. A cease-fire with Hamas still in power means Israel loses. That's all that ultimately counts, which is why they demand a cease-fire, but never with the condition that Hamas be disarmed and removed from power."

In comparison, there are 7 times more UN staff serving refugees in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThere are more UN staff in the Gaza Strip than the total employees of the World Bank with more than 10,000 employees in over 120 offices worldwide?\n\nThere are more UN staff in Gaza than in Geneva (8,500 UN staff) or New York (6,400 UN staff)? Gaza has twice as many UN Staff than in New York.\n\nUNRWA leverages the UN brand to appear to casual observers as a team of relatively unbiased international aid workers, when in fact they're a $ 1 billion/year Palestinian business, run by Palestinians and staffed by Palestinians.\n\nThey need Palestinian refugees to exist. If Palestinians got their state, there would be no more \"refugees,\" and the business and flow of aid money would end. It's in their best interests to perpetuate the conflict and leave Palestinian statehood up in the air. UNRWA schools literally taught a whole generation of Gazans to hate their neighbors and make unrealistic demands so that the core issue of sovereignty is never addressed.\n\nIts sole achievements are radicalizing Palestinian children and keeping Palestinians refugees for generations. As you have read in the news recently, they also kept some of the hostages.\n\nUNRWA should have been disbanded decades ago, all they do is perpetuate the conflict and keep Palestinians poor and uneducated."

The parasitic ideas that led to their grotesque testimony have been festering in academia for decades, and have fully choked the larger culture.  Getting rid of one administrator will simply result in another equally cowardly and lobotomized leader taking over.  There is a long conveyor belt of such academic administrators.  The battle can only be won on the ideological and epistemological battlefields.  In the same way that Lysenkoism or blood letting are rejected ideas, the same must occur with all of the idea pathogens that define Woke Progressive Ideology."

Nor just the fallen soldiers. In the last few weeks 1000s of soldiers have had life changing injuries. The societal cost is beyond calculation.\n\nSo there is no turning back the clock to Oct 6. The Israelis will not - and should not ever accept such an outcome.\n\nWe have had enough of sacrificing Jews as part of some stupid attempt to be liked or accepted. Enough of choosing to accomodate daily threats against our existence. If anyone wants peace with Israel - then let them have it - but there will be no more games played with those that don't. No more weeping mothers paying a price for the empty dreams of naive fools.\n\nThe Jews suffered the worst atrocitiy since the Holocaust on Oct 7. Did it make any difference? Look around you at the hate - even in an hour of enormous grief - the streets of the west are full of people who choose to stand with the terrorists. \n\nThe terrorists attempted a genocide of Jews and in our streets they sing for victory to the Intifada.\n\nMedia outlets have chosen to demonise Israel - simply for defending itself against terrorists. Celebrities - who said nothing as millions died elsewhere - suddenly obsess over Israel and share the words of Hamas spokesmen.\n\nThis is the reality of the world in which the Jews live. Since 1993 Israel tried over and over again to make peace. In return all it received were rockets - with the UN rushing to invoke article 99 as soon as Israel responded to the unspeakable atrocities of a death cult.\n\n1993 and all that has happened since has been an awful mistake.  1000s of Jews have been buried for nothing.\n\nThe Israeli right wing told us the rockets would fly from Gaza as far back as 1994. They were ridiculed and called extremists. Turns out they were right all along. \n\nThere is no current partner for peace. The Palestinians have no leader that can deliver on any promises. That is the truth we have to learn to accept. And not a single further Jewish life should be sacrified on the alter of fake promises. If one day they want peace - then let them come to us.\n\nYou think the world will hate us if we draw these lines in the sand? Look around you, they hate us anyway."

For example a number of people brought up Deir Yassin.  Some of the approx 107 villagers murdered in the attack were merely fleeing or surrendering.  This was executed by Irgun and Lehi, which I think would be fair to characterize as violent extremist groups, or even terror groups.\n\nThe massacre was condemned by the leadership of the Haganah, and the Jewish Agency for Palestine sent Jordan's King Abdullah a letter of apology.\n\nHowever, he held them responsible for it and warned of \"terrible consequences\" if similar incidents occurred.\n\nFour days later, on April 13, there was a reprisal attack on the Hadassah medical convoy in Jerusalem which ended in a massacre killing 78 Jews, most of whom were the medical staff.  \n\nI think it's fair to say that both sides had engaged in a fair bit of violence and brutality, before even the creation of Israel. There's been so many massacres on the Jewish populations for years and years prior to Israel. And I imagine that some of the Jews that came over to Palestine were thugs and willing to engage in similar tactics.\n\nThere were also the attacks on the British.\n\nSome of the Arabs who fled Israeli territory I'm sure were simply afraid of reprisals by some of the more extremist elements. \n\nI think we need to acknowledge the pain of both people and realities if we are to move on.\n\nBut I also think we must live in the today and figure out solutions that might work for BOTH people TODAY."
