        "text": "\"Credit for Hamas’s achievement belongs as well to the international, pro-Palestinian united front that includes five members of the U.S. House of Representatives known as “the squad.” For the past several decades, this well-organized advocacy network has been arduously promoting the big lie that Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, plus the absence of a “two-state solution,” leaves the Palestinians with no recourse other than continued armed resistance, including the killing of innocent civilians. That twin falsehood, now endorsed by the UN chief, was repeated over and over again at the massive pro-Hamas demonstrations in the Western democracies. It is also echoed in parts of the mainstream media.\n\nWhat’s most astonishing (and depressing) about the durability of this particular libel is not merely that there are mountains of historical evidence debunking it, but that Palestinian leaders themselves have repeatedly acknowledged there is no connection at all between Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and the war they have chosen to wage against the Jewish state. Palestinian terrorists were sent to slaughter Jews during the years when there was an occupation, and they murdered innocent Jews when there was no occupation at all.\n\nIn the century since the British army liberated the Palestinian people from four centuries of brutal Ottoman occupation, they have had three preeminent political leaders: Haj Amin al-Husseini, Yasser Arafat, and Mahmoud Abbas. At several points during their varied careers, each had to make a fateful choice for their people between two separate historical paths. The first path would have led to an end of foreign occupation (either British or Israeli) and the creation of an independent Palestinian state. But it would also have required the Palestinians to end their war against the Jews and give up the dream of exclusive sovereignty throughout the land. The second path was to persist in trying to eradicate Zionism or (later) the Jewish state, but at the price of continued occupation. On four separate occasions—in 1937, 1947, 2000, and 2008—those leaders chose the second path, meaning more killing of Jews and more occupation, and more misery for their own people.\n\nA foretaste of the ruin to come occurred in Jerusalem on April 4, 1920, during the traditional Muslim procession known as Nebi Musa. As a result of the British miliary victory in the recent Great War, Palestinian Arabs enjoyed significant political rights for the first time in their history. At that moment there was no Zionist occupation anywhere in the land. Nevertheless, Palestinian leaders were not inclined to use politics and public diplomacy to press for their goal of ending Jewish immigration. At the procession, Muslim notables harangued Arab mobs to storm into the Jewish Quarter in an orgy of killings, looting, and rape. The victims were mostly pious Jews who had lived in the Holy City for generations and cared not at all about political Zionism. Because the Palestinian Arabs didn’t yet have guns or bombs, the casualty figures were low by contemporary standards: Only six Jews were murdered, 200 injured, and two Jewish women raped.\n\nOne of the ring leaders of the Nebi Musa riots was Haj Amin al-Husseini, the younger brother of the mayor of Jerusalem. Another was Aref al-Aref, the 27-year-old editor of the Palestinian Arab journal Southern Syria. The politically active journalist rode through the gathering crowd on horseback, chanting, “Palestine is our land and the Jews are our dogs.”\n\nIt took the British authorities several days to restore order. Haj Amin al-Husseini and Aref al-Aref were tried and sentenced to 10 years in prison by a British military court, but they escaped the city. After this first of many Palestinian pogroms, the British government appointed Herbert Samuel, a British Jew with alleged Zionist sympathies, as high commissioner of the mandate’s civil administration.\n\nOne of Samuel’s first official acts was to pardon al-Husseini and appoint the 26-year-old Islamist agitator as the grand mufti of Jerusalem, charged with overseeing the city’s Muslim holy places. Samuel also rubber-stamped al-Husseini’s election as president of the Supreme Muslim Council. With those titles, the former Nebi Musa rioter became the most powerful political and religious leader among the Palestinian Arabs.\n\nCommissioner Samuel’s strategy, taken from the British imperial playbook, was to contain anti-colonial resistance by doling out political patronage to rebellious leaders of the native population. In the case of the Palestinian Arabs, the approach was doomed to failure. Palestinian Jew-hatred was already deeply entrenched and infused with Islamist religious doctrines. It could not be contained by political concessions then, or for the next hundred years.\n\nIn 1929, al-Husseini used his seat of power to instigate new atrocities against the Jews—the Palestinian version of Kristallnacht. There was still no “Zionist occupation” of Arab land, but the mufti spread the rumor that the Jews were plotting to take over the Haram al-Sharif (the Dome of the Rock) above the Western Wall. His followers responded by again attacking the defenseless Jewish Quarter, this time killing more than 130 innocents. A few days later, an Arab mob turned the Orthodox Jewish community in Hebron into a killing field. Sixty-seven Jews were murdered, women were raped, and several men were castrated.\n\nYet again, the British authorities sought to constrain the violence by offering political gifts to the perpetrators. A white paper issued by the British government declared that Jewish immigration would be limited, based on the country’s “economic absorptive capacity.” The Palestinians and their maximum leader, al-Husseini, were not pacified.\n\nAl-Husseini was soon elected chairman of the eight-member Arab Higher Committee (AHC), which became the ruling political body for the Palestinian Arabs for the next 15 years. The AHC then initiated a full-scale rebellion against the British occupation. This time, the Palestinians had enough guns and bombs to launch hit-and-run guerrilla attacks against the overstretched British military forces. The declared aim of the revolt was the ouster of the mandatory regime and the elimination of the Yishuv, the name given to the organized Zionist community in Palestine.\n\nIn the middle of the revolt, the British government offered the Palestinians the biggest political prize yet. A royal commission of inquiry chaired by Lord William Peel investigated the causes of the unrest and, in 1937, recommended the first-ever “two-state solution”—the partition of Palestine into an Arab and a Jewish state. The Arabs would receive 90 percent of the territory for their state with the Jews allocated a tiny strip along the Mediterranean coast. The AHC, with chairman al-Husseini weighing in from exile in Lebanon, immediately rejected the offer and demanded Arab rule over the entire land of Palestine. David Ben-Gurion, the leader of the Yishuv, provisionally accepted the plan.\n\nThe debate over the Peel Commission’s recommendations became moot when the AHC resumed the military revolt. British forces didn’t fully succeed in crushing the uprising until the eve of World War II in Europe. In the meantime, al-Husseini had moved on to Iraq, where he participated in the abortive pro-Nazi revolt against the country’s British-backed government. Al-Husseini then fled to Germany, where he was welcomed by the Führer and hailed as a partner in the struggle against world Jewry.\n\nThe mufti never felt so appreciated as he did during his years in Berlin. He was provided with a large house and staff and invited to meetings with Heinrich Himmler to discuss the war against the Jews. He had the honor of reviewing troops of the Wehrmacht and directly helped the German war machine by recruiting Bosnian Muslims for the Waffen SS.\n\nAs an experienced propagandist, the mufti was put to work overseeing Arabic-language broadcasts promoting the affinities between Nazi ideology and Islamic Jew-hatred. At a private meeting in November 1941, Hitler informed al-Husseini about the coming extermination of the European Jews. In the German archives there is a summary memo of that fateful meeting in which the Führer also tells the mufti that his next objective would be “the destruction of the Jewish element residing in the Arab sphere under the protection of British power.”\n\nThe reason that the mufti allied himself with Germany was not that Germany was the enemy of his enemy, i.e., the British occupiers. Beginning in the mid-1930s, he came under the influence of Nazi racial doctrines and created a Palestinian organization modeled after the Hitler youth. He also sent Palestinian delegations to the Nazi Nuremberg rallies. According to the widely respected German historians Klaus Michael Mallmann and Martin Cüppers, if Rommel’s Afrikacorps had won the battle at El Alamein and then conquered Palestine, the Mufti would have gone along to supervise another Final Solution for the Jews of Palestine.\n\nAfter the German surrender, the mufti was captured by French military forces and placed under “house arrest” in a villa outside Paris. The Yugoslav government requested his extradition to face trial for the war crimes he had committed in the Balkans. But al-Husseini was shielded from prosecution by high-level government officials in the U.S. and France determined to protect Western influence in the Arab world.\n\nIn June 1946, French security forces guarding the house where al-Husseini was detained conveniently left the door open and he “escaped” to Egypt. The mufti was granted asylum and received a rapturous reception. In Cairo, he was greeted as a conquering hero by the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hassan al-Banna. The mufti, al-Banna declared, “challenged an empire and fought Zionism with the help of Hitler and Germany. Germany and Hitler are gone, but Amin al-Husseini will continue the struggle.”\n\nWithin months, al-Husseini was reinstated as chairman of the Arab Higher Committee, now officially recognized in international forums as representing the Palestinian Arabs. With Great Britain winding down the Palestine mandate, the AHC vehemently opposed any discussion of partition, and al-Husseini’s armed gangs threatened and intimidated Palestinians who thought otherwise. After the passage of the UN partition resolution in November 1947, al-Banna and al-Husseini combined forces and sent thousands of fighters into Palestine to begin the first full-scale war against the Yishuv with the intent of aborting the Jewish state. It was the second time during the mufti’s tenure that he chose to continue the war against the Jews rather than accept a plan that would free his people from foreign occupation and allow them to establish an independent state in most of the homeland.\n\nDuring that period, the American left understood that the emerging Jewish state was threatened by enemies steeped in Nazi doctrines of eliminationist anti-Semitism. Before the UN General Assembly voted on the partition resolution, the Nation magazine submitted a lengthy report to all the member states titled “The Arab Higher Committee: Its Origins, Personnel, and Purposes.” Supervised by longtime Nation editor Freda Kirchwey, the report urged a vote for partition and declared that the AHC was “an almost exact equivalent, in Middle Eastern terms, of the cabal that ruled Hitler’s Germany.”\n\nThe theme that the Palestinians were led by Nazi collaborators was also stressed in the dispatches written by the legendary leftist reporter I.F. Stone. In This Is Israel, Stone’s book about the 1948 War of Independence, he refers to the Jewish state as a “tiny bridgehead” of 650,000 surrounded by 30 million Arabs. He quotes the head of the Arab League, Abdul Rahman Azzam, declaring, “This war will be a war of extermination and a momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongol massacres and the Crusades.”\n\nStone blamed al-Husseini and the Arab Higher Committee for creating the Palestinian refugee crisis. The Palestinian leaders reminded him of the fascists he had fought with his pen since the Spanish Civil War, and he ticked off the names of Nazi veterans leading Palestinian military units attacking Jewish settlements. “German Nazis, Polish reactionaries, Yugoslav Chetniks, and Bosnian Moslems flocked [into Palestine] for the war against the Jews,” Stone reported.\n\nThe Jewish state won its war of independence, but 90 percent of the Palestinian people came under foreign occupation. The Kingdom of Jordan annexed the West Bank, Egypt took control of Gaza, yet there were no anti-occupation protests by the local population. The new arrangement was particularly rewarding for Aref al-Aref, veteran of the 1920 Nebi Musa riots. He became mayor of Arab Jerusalem and loyally served the kingdom of Jordan for the duration. He also had time to write a history of the Palestinian struggle, titled The Nakba of Jerusalem and the Lost Paradise.\n\nDuring the period of Jordanian and Egyptian occupation, there were few opportunities for Palestinians to fight the war against the Jews directly. Instead, the legend of the Nakba was used to depict the creation of the Jewish state as a “catastrophe” for the land’s native people. So much so that Israel had to be erased by any means necessary. During this brief interregnum, the Nakba myth allowed the Palestinians to continue the struggle through historical narrative.\n\n_____________\n\nIt is true that after winning the 1967 war, Israel took over the West Bank and the occupation continued for the next 56 years. (The occupation of Gaza was ended unilaterally by Israel 18 years ago.) It is equally true that Israeli governments of both the left and right worked assiduously to end the occupation and allow the Palestinians to create their own independent state. Israel’s left-wing labor government initiated the Oslo process in early 1993. By September of that year, it culminated with the famous handshake on the White House lawn between Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.\n\nAt the time, Arafat was stranded in Tunis in a very precarious position. His PLO cadres were expelled from Jordan in 1970, thrown out of Beirut by Israel’s army in 1982, and then again kicked out of Tripoli, Lebanon, by the Syrians. Arafat’s reputation was in tatters among the Arab governments because of his impetuous decision to support Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait. Yet the Rabin government was so determined to end the occupation and achieve a two-state solution that it threw Yasser Arafat a lifeline and made him a serious negotiating partner. According to their signed agreement, Arafat would be brought back to the West Bank to preside over a fledgling Palestinian government. After a five-year interim period, the parties would negotiate a final-status arrangement that contemplated an independent Palestinian state living in peace with Israel.\n\nIn the spring of 1998, Arafat and his top lieutenants in the Palestinian Authority (PA) began conferring about the final-status negotiations due to begin shortly. It was at this point that Arafat announced the first commemoration of Nakba Day. To avoid delivering on the promises he had made five years earlier, Arafat chose to weaponize the Palestinian Nakba narrative into a declaration of permanent war against the Jewish state. The key element of his May 15 Nakba Day speech was the claim of 5 million Palestinian refugees who had a sacred “right of return” to their homes in Jaffa, Haifa, and dozens of formerly Arab towns and villages in Israel. From his Ramallah headquarters, the PA president read out the marching orders for the day’s violent demonstrations over Palestinian radio stations and public loudspeakers:\n\nThe Nakba has thrown us out of our homes and dispersed us around the globe. Historians may search, but they will not find any nation subjugated to as much torture as ours. We are not asking for a lot. We are not asking for the moon. We are asking to close the chapter of Nakba once and for all, for the refugees to return and to build an independent Palestinian state on our land, our land, our land, just like other peoples.\nBy “our land” Arafat included Israel, thus unilaterally ending the Oslo process.\"\n\nhttps://t.co/hsMl1hJIwW",

        "text": "On Jewish Decolonization\nOr Why at least four empires (Austro-Hungarian, Russian, Ottoman, British) had to go for the Jewish people to finally be decolonized and achieve self-determination, sovereignty and independence in their land.\n\nPolitical history from the mid 19th century on is generally marked by greater human equality and civic participation. Essential to that development was the replacement of empires by self-governing sovereign nation states. In this process, which is sometimes referred to as decolonization, multi-ethnic and multinational empires were replaced, typically through a bloody process of imperial breakup and retreat, by new self-governing states, with the imperial center transformed also into one of the states (e.g. Russia, Austria, Turkey, France, Britain, Holland). This global process of imperial breakup and replacement by sovereign states, which underpinned the drive towards greater equality, has been bloody, involving two world wars, numerous regional wars and civil wars, ethnic cleansing and genocide.\n\nWhen lucky, the new self-governing states are based on the principle of self-determination and possess a relative collective coherence of common language, ethnicity, national identity and reference religion. The reason the more coherent states are generally luckier is that they are able to move more rapidly and effectively towards equal citizenship and democratic participation. When less lucky, the borders of the new states are delineated by the receding empires, forcing different ethnic groups into a single state with none a clear majority. Those less coherent countries typically descend into civil war, dictatorship or both, with the process sometimes culminating in a bloody breakup into smaller, more coherent nation states.\n\nThe process of self-determination for a people of an empire typically involved the following stages:\n1. Developing the idea that a group of people sharing a common language, ethnicity and reference religion constitute a nation\n2. Mobilizing the masses for national self-determination while building the institutions\n3. Battling for control of territory free from empire and against other claimants\n4. Attaining independence for the new nation-state\n\nThese processes may be intertwined and simultaneous, but typically they all happen under one imperial yoke that has to be overthrown for the new state to emerge.\n\nHowever, for the Jewish people, given their unique conditions of extended exile, dispersion and dispossession, at least four imperial yokes had to be overthrown before the Jewish people could partake in this universal process of decolonization and attain the status of a sovereign self-governing nation. The empires each broadly correspond to one of the stages of self-determination:\n\n1. Habsburg/Austro-Hungarian Empire - the idea that the Jews are a people - one people - and deserving of the universal right to self determination in their own homeland - Zionism - was (not coincidentally) born and crystallized in the multi-ethnic, multi-national Habsburg/Austria-Hungarian Empire, where in parallel to imperial decline, numerous peoples were rising up to claim the right to govern themselves by themselves, free of imperial control. Among the rising Czechs, Slovaks, Germans, Hungarians, Poles and Ukrainians, there was no question that the Jews constituted a distinct people as well. While Theodor Herzl was a uniquely gifted and visionary individual, it is probably no coincidence that Zionism as a clear political idea emerged and was developed by a person who was born in Budapest and educated in Vienna at the precise moment of the national fermentation among the peoples of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.\n2. Russian Empire - the mobilization of the masses for the idea of national self-determination took place mostly in the lands of the declining Russian Empire. As various peoples and nations were gripped by revolutionary and national spirit which ultimately brought down Tsarist Russia and its domains and created the Soviet Empire, the Jewish people of the Russian Empire, where most of them lived and retained the clearest sense of cohesive national consciousness, flocked to Zionism as one response to a ground that was clearly burning underneath them. Together with Herzl’s genius for mobilization and institution building and their own grassroots efforts, the preliminary institutions of the emerging nation - from congress to government began to emerge (the collapse of the Soviet Empire completed this process a century later).\n3. Ottoman Empire - All new states had to wrest, typically through war and violence, their territory from the declining empire and against competing claims. The Jews, as an exiled and dispossessed people had to court international legitimacy and purchase land tracts in the empire which controlled their ancestral land, the Ottoman (Of-course the Ottoman Empire and previous Islamic empires did the Jews the favor of ridding the land of the most important imperial yoke - the Roman Empire). The collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of WWI freed the Land of Israel for Jewish self determination. This was acknowledged by the League of Nations, which oversaw the process of replacing the Ottoman imperial lands with new states for the local peoples: Turks, Kurds, Armenians, Arabs and Jews. (It is worth mentioning that had the Jews received their fair share of imperial lands based on their share of the population the territory for their state would have been multiple times the size of what Israel is today). (Also worth noting that the Turks violently ignored the principle of self determination in their immediate vicinity, preventing thereby the emergence of Armenia and Kurdistan, enlarging Turkey to twice the size allocated to it by the League of Nations. The Arabs tried - and some still try - to do something similar to the Jewish people, but without success…)\n4. The British Empire - Tragically, the Jewish people were not immediately accorded self-determination in the Land of Israel, but were subjected to an interim form of semi-imperial governance by the British. But despite the fact that the British were entrusted with the Mandate in the service of Jewish self-determination, their still powerful imperial interests led them to cave repeatedly into Arab violence and betray the terms of the Mandate, preventing the emergence of Jewish sovereignty in the 1930’s and restricting Jewish immigration at the most desperate time for the Jewish people, condemning hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Jews, who could have immigrated to their sovereign state, to genocide in Europe. Only after the British Empire finally collapsed after WWII and multiple states emerged from the wreckage, such as India and Pakistan, could the Jewish people finally declare independence, not before the Arabs waged yet another bloody campaign to prevent that from happening.\n\nIn sum, if any people should rank as the highest symbol of decolonization and post imperial sovereignty and independence, it is the Jewish people, a people who had to survive and outlive four declining empires, before they could finally be, like all peoples, political masters of their fate in their own land."

Manasra was imprisoned when he was 13 for going on a stabbing spree on October 12, 2015, during the Knife Intifada with his cousin Hassan, 15. The pair critically wounded a 13-year-old boy and moderately wounded a 25-year-old man. \n\nThe spree ended when police shot Hassan and a passing motorist hit Ahmad. Ahmad was taken to an Israeli hospital. He admitted to investigators: “I went there to stab Jews.” He was later tried and convicted on two counts of attempted murder.\n\nIn her now-deleted post, Hadid claimed Manasra was \"abducted\" & randomly accused Israel of \"raping and murdering\" innocent people.\n\nhttps://t.co/ChVUygNm0z",

Listen to me very carefully because this is my last words on this matter.  \n\nBecause of you, I found myself now watching photos and videos archives from hell in the last hour. \n\nMy soul will probably never recover from it. I’ve seen a lot as a legal consultant for criminal law but this will haunt me. \n\nThen I understood, I understood the satanic propaganda plan of Iran-Hamas-ISIS  with this systematic questioning of the atrocities.  It’s not only to try to escape responsibility, it’s also to force us to put that crap in the public domain for their amusement and satanic mind f*ck. \n\nIt doesn't really matter what and how much I show you of what was there. \n\nFrom the rape, the tying up, the burning alive of whole families, the execution, the body parts, the pleasure in stepping on corpses for selfie purposes of these despicable killers and the inhumane abuse of human beings, the elderly, the women, the children, babies, and yes, even defenseless soldiers caught by surprise.\n\nIt doesn't matter what and how much I will show all of the graphic details, the propaganda machine will always find a new avenue of lies and make it viral with huge vile Twitter accounts bought in advance.  \n\nIt started with complete denial of the massacre then went to ‘no civilians were killed’, it went to \"everything is AI manufactured\" and it continued to “the IDF killed most of them, they are actually freedom fighters who wanted only to kidnap some soldiers in exchange for political prisoners and were very nice to those they kidnapped because they are humane and good Muslims”.  \nOh, and from the river to the sea kill all the Jews of course. \n\nYou are so ridiculous. \nThere is nothing in reality that even resembles the monstrous dimensions of what was really happening in Oct. 7.  \n\nTo the piles of weapons, to the ordered lists and maps, to the systematic execution, to the abuse of the bodies, to the abuse of women and children, to the burning methods with tires, gas cylinders, RPGs and the piles of artillery that were unleashed there.  \n\nThere is nothing that will describe the atrocities of thousands of bloodthirsty human animals, the feasters of murder and the plunderers of bodies, there is nothing like it and nothing you will see will convince anyone who still believes in this Satan's propaganda machine.  \n\nSure you can find and twist all those “evidence” taken completely out of context, I could go over them one by one until I loos my mind, but I’m not going to, this is not a game and if you want to play, you will do it with the stupid people that still go for it. \n\nI understand that they are dying to put Israelis in a trap of either we pour snuff videos here that and they use it to humiliate us, the families and friends and colleagues that will need to see this horrific abuse running around and relive the trauma of October 7th on the town square so they can celebrate it, \n\nor - we are \"liars\".  \n\nThey will keep doing it to our minds, if we let them. I will not. \n\nLet one thing be clear: \nThis “game” might work with Israel until October 6th. Maybe a few more days of shock. We’re not there anymore. \n\nI am sorry world. \nI believe with all my heart that everyone who holds the values ​​of life and non-violence knows that we are right. But we have long passed the stage of \"who is right\" we are in the stage of who will be left to tell the story. We will not be silenced again.\n\nAnd I am absolutely sure that if there is a God up there, he knows. And he will make all of them pay. \n\nHe will settle accounts with these human monsters in Gaza, the direct killers and all their supporters, the looters and the helpers and the celebrators of barbarism."
