This is a story about Amit who served as an on-call paramedic at Kibbutz Be'eri. When terrorists began to infiltrate the kibbutz, Amit took her first aid kit and ran to the clinic to treat the wounded. She corresponded with her family members for hours, she begged for help and hoped that someone would come to save her and the wounded she treated, she did not run away, she did not hide, the terrorists fired an RPG at the clinic, she continued to save lives. For more than seven hours, Amit was locked in the clinic, together with a doctor and a nurse, they tried to treat the wounded who were besieged inside, the kibbutz's security team guarded the outside and fought the terrorists who tried to penetrate inside. The terrorists slowly approached them and wanted to occupy the clinic, but Amit did not give up any wounded, until the last moment. at one in the afternoon the terrorists managed to take control of the clinic, they threw dozens of grenades inside, Amit wrote to her family: \"They are back, I don't think we will be able to survive this\", and added: \"Pray for us, be strong if something happens to me\", \"Mom  I love you, think only good things about me\", Her worried sister called, Amit answered and said that the terrorists had murdered everyone and shot her in the legs. She made an artery occlusion on herself and then a shot rang out and the call was cut off. The terrorists returned again and shot her in the head from a very short range and in her stomach. Her body was found two days later, Amit's sun disappeared. The terrorists did not come to her apartment in the kibbutz, and if she had stayed there, she might have stayed alive, but Amit did what she believed in, with infinite dedication, and it cost her her life. It's a story about courage. This is a story about the beautiful face of a Amit, who enlightened so many people around her, and about life, which was most sacred to her."

This is called Jewish Emancipation. For Jews in Germany, this means that they become equal citizens before the law. For example, there are no more legal restrictions on where Jews can live and what jobs they can hold.\n\n‚Ä¢ In the summer of 1914, Germany enters World War I. At least 100,000 German-Jewish soldiers serve in this war. The majority of these Jews fight on the front lines. By the end of the war, 12,000 of them lose their lives.¬†\n\n‚Ä¢ The majority of Jews (approximately 70%) lived in large cities with populations over 100,000. In comparison, about 50% of non-Jewish Germans lived in towns with fewer than 10,000 people. Nonetheless, some Jews did live in smaller towns and rural areas.¬†\n\n‚Ä¢ Many Jews rarely or never attended a synagogue. But, most continued to celebrate Jewish holidays. A minority of Jews in Germany strictly observed Jewish religious practices.¬†\n\n‚Ä¢ Some Jews were poor, while most Jews were middle class. Many worked in or owned small businesses. Jews also worked as tailors, civil servants, doctors, lawyers, journalists, bank clerks, factory workers, professors, and teachers. A few were wealthy business owners.\n\n‚Ä¢ Many Jews saw themselves as a religious group. They were Germans who practiced Judaism. Others saw themselves as an ethnic group. They were Jews who lived in Germany.¬†\n\n‚Ä¢ Despite being integrated into German society, Jews faced discrimination in Germany. For example, not all Germans believed that Jews could be German. Some groups, including many university student clubs, banned Jews from membership. \n\nSo as you can see they were not in power for Hitler to ‚Äúget his country back‚Äù from Jews."

        "text": "I‚Äôd like to address a recent argument that Arab opposition to Zionism is only due to its ‚Äúpractice‚Äù rather than its principle. That argument would require plenty of evidence of Arab support for Zionism that went sour only once Zionism was practiced ‚Äúbadly‚Äù. There is no such evidence. Quite the contrary. \n\nArab opposition to Zionism was, from the beginning, opposition to the principle, because the idea of a Jewish right to self determination was itself unacceptable. Why? Two small reasons and one big. \n\nOne small reason: general opposition to immigration. No-one likes immigrants and Arabs are no exception. This is a small reason, because if it were only about immigration, the conflict would not have become what it is.\n\nAnother small reason: massive numerical imbalance: Arabs were the overwhelming majority in the entire region of the Middle East - they saw no reason why they should entertain any kind of compromise with a minority group. This is a small reason, because had it been only that, some measure of land given to the Jews would have been ultimately acceptable. \n\nBut the big reason, the one that underlies the conflict and explains its tenacity, that is at the root of the total and blanket rejection of the principle of Zionism, long before it had the chance to be ‚Äúbadly implemented‚Äù is that Zionism, as a liberation movement that envisioned equal dignity for the Jewish people as a people in the midst of the vast lands claimed to the Arab world and Islam, challenged the social and theological ‚Äúproper place‚Äù of the Jew.\n\nAnd what is that ‚Äúproper place‚Äù of the Jew? Stateless, powerless, of lower status and dignity, and most important - living at the exclusive protection and mercy of the Arab and Muslim ruler. The one thing Jews, individually and collectively, could not do is protect themselves by themselves.\n\nThe historian Bernard Lewis observed that the status of Jews in Arab and Muslim lands was never as good or as bad as it was in Europe, but there was never any question that the Jew was not the equal of the Arab and Muslim. \n\nImagine the civilizational shock when Jews in the name of Zionism claim themselves to be the equals, individually and collectively of Arabs and Muslims, and insisting on defending themselves by themselves. \n\nThese kinds of transformations are not easily accepted, and certainly not without violence. \n\nAnd that is the issue: from the beginning Zionism encountered ever growing Arab and Muslim violence opposed to the very principle of Jewish equality and self-determination, not to the manner of its implementation.\n\nIf anything, Zionism took care to implement itself in the most agreeable way: working through land purchase, and mostly malaria infested land, eradicating malaria, and creating prosperity. It ensured whatever international legitimacy was available at the time - a unanimous agreement of the League of Nations to its project. It made it clear that it sought to live with and next to Arabs, and perhaps naively imagined that as a movement that sought to build and develop, rather than exploit, it would be embraced. \n\nThe idea that Arabs oppose Zionism because it displaced them is a ahistorical argument that reverses cause and effect. \n\nIt is because of Arab violent opposition to Zionism that:\n\n1) Jews were denied their state in the 1930‚Äôs and had the gates closed to Jewish immigration at the most difficult moment in Jewish history (few people realize the extent to which Arab violence in the 1930‚Äôs condemned hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Jews to mass killing in Europe, when they could have still escaped)\n\n2) Arabs became refugees in a completely unnecessary war. Displacement was the outcome of a war that need never have happened if Arabs had accepted partition. \n\nArab displacement was not the cause of Arab Anti-Zionism - it was its tragic outcome. \n\nAnd the path to peace remains today the same as it always was, for Arabs to abandon Anti-Zionism, and we can all live side by side in peace."

Its a story about Shahar and Sharon. They went to the Nova music festival with their friends, they were at the beginning of life, they came to celebrate peace and love. When the terrorists infiltrated the Nova festival, Sharon, Shahar and Oriya ran to their car, Shahar was shot on the way, but still managed to drive about 10 kilometers to Kibbutz Miflasim. In a phone conversation between his mother and Sharon, she screamed: \"They shot Shahar in the neck!, Shahar is losing consciousness\". But in Kibbutz Miflasim more monsters were waiting for them and shot at them, Shahar was shot repeatedly until he closed his eyes. Sharon got out of the car with Oriya and they both ran and hid. Sharon inform Shahar's mother that he had died, she also corresponded with her two brothers, Eli and Avial. Eli, who was in his car, decided to drive immediately in their direction, he did everything he could to get to the place, but the terrorists also murdered him and his body was found about 150 meters from Shahar's car. Aviel, Sharon's second brother, arrived the next day at the same place, he found Shahar's car and Shahar dead inside. 26 hours, Shahar remained there shot, surrounded by hundreds of other bodies. 4 days later Sharon's body was found, Oriya was also murdered and found near a nearby tree. No one survived. This is a painful story. It's a story about a brother who wanted to save his sister from hell, about friends who went to a party but found themselves in a nightmare from which they never woke up. It is a story that is hard to hear and hard to tell. This is a story about Sharon, Shahar, Eli and Oriya, friends, brothers, Beautiful souls that will never return. This is the last photo that Shahar, Sharon and Oriya took at the Nova festival. Eli on the right."

He arrived in Sderot on the morning of October 7th to visit his brothers who work there, he came from a nearby Bedouin village, his two small children were still sleeping when he left. On the road in Sderot he ran into another family, the Swissa family - minutes earlier, terrorists shot the father of the family who was mortally wounded and the frightened mother, Odaya, stayed in the car with her daughters and screamed for help. Amar watched what was happening from the side while talking to his father who begged him to go home immediately, but Amar could not ignore it and said: \"Father, there is a mother and two girls in front of me in danger, I must help them\". Amar got into Odaya's car, and started driving after a policeman towards the police station in the city. What they didn't know was that the terrorists were waiting for them there too, two monsters who surprised them in the middle of the road, shot Amar and Odaya who was with him in the car and shot the policeman after whom Amar drove to the police station, the terrorists approached the car and shot repeatedly at Amar and Odaya, the little girls hid in the back seat and were not hurt. A security man passing by rescued them, the father who was shot at first, died of his wounds in the hospital. The girls (3,6) remained orphans. This is a story about Amar, who could have run away and might have been able to reach his children, this is a story about a hero who chose to stay and save someone else's childhood at the cost of his life."

She said she understands it will require a lot of strength, but she is open to listen to them and help‚Ä¶ \n\nShe also added that the police have so far collected only a small number of eyewitness accounts of sex crimes, along with many testimonies from military personnel, Zaka and other rescue forces who arrived at the scenes of the massacre and that is all in comparison to the police‚Äôs records of corpses - both of women and men - found naked and whose genitals were mutilated. The implication is that there are more corpses with genitals mutilation and traces of sexual crimes compared to witness testimonies they have collected\n\nLet me quote another paragraph that shows why your quote is inverted:\nAdri emphasizes that although there is a lot of documented scenes of bodies from the massacre that appear to have been sexually assaulted, the investigators are still busy looking for additional reinforcement for the evidence and testimonies. \"We're looking for more than a single witness. For each scene we're looking for cross reference for what happened there\n\nBasically for each case they try to have at least two independent verifications before investigators consider it confirmed  \n\nHere is the full article anyway for everyone to read:\nhttps://t.co/fJNjlObbyy",

This is a story about Avi, who went out on October 7 for a ride with his friends as he used to do every Saturday. While they were getting to refuel, missiles started passing over their heads and they ran to the shelter, where they waited for about half an hour. They realized something was wrong when the rockets and the alarm didn't stop. In the WhatsApp group he managed to write that he was hiding. While waiting, he realized that terrorists had infiltrated the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKibbutz Zikim, which is close to him, his son called and Avi told him, \"We are fine, we know about the terrorists. We will come home soon\". Avi did not know that the terrorists had also infiltrated the city where he lived. He and his friends set off quickly. A few minutes passed and in one of the streets in front of him 4 monsters appeared who shot at him and sprayed him with dozens of bullets and he fell to the ground. His aunt Rachel who lived nearby recognized his motorcycle and ran to him, but there was nothing she could do to save him. She took the helmet off his head and closed his eyes for eternal rest. It's a story about a Avi who went out on Saturday morning to ride his motorcycle and just wanted to go back to hug his children. This is a story about Avi whose life was taken, And now he will watch over his children from heaven. This is his last picture."

This is called Jewish Emancipation. For Jews in Germany, this means that they become equal citizens before the law. For example, there are no more legal restrictions on where Jews can live and what jobs they can hold.\n\n‚Ä¢ In the summer of 1914, Germany enters World War I. At least 100,000 German-Jewish soldiers serve in this war. The majority of these Jews fight on the front lines. By the end of the war, 12,000 of them lose their lives.¬†\n\n‚Ä¢ The majority of Jews (approximately 70%) lived in large cities with populations over 100,000. In comparison, about 50% of non-Jewish Germans lived in towns with fewer than 10,000 people. Nonetheless, some Jews did live in smaller towns and rural areas.¬†\n\n‚Ä¢ Many Jews rarely or never attended a synagogue. But, most continued to celebrate Jewish holidays. A minority of Jews in Germany strictly observed Jewish religious practices.¬†\n\n‚Ä¢ Some Jews were poor, while most Jews were middle class. Many worked in or owned small businesses. Jews also worked as tailors, civil servants, doctors, lawyers, journalists, bank clerks, factory workers, professors, and teachers. A few were wealthy business owners.\n\n‚Ä¢ Many Jews saw themselves as a religious group. They were Germans who practiced Judaism. Others saw themselves as an ethnic group. They were Jews who lived in Germany.¬†\n\n‚Ä¢ Despite being integrated into German society, Jews faced discrimination in Germany. For example, not all Germans believed that Jews could be German.
