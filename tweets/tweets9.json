He was not in his home for 80 days, his whole life changed. One of the hardest things we had to do was tell him that mom won't come back, and that we're looking for dad. As an adult, it's hard for me to digest, I don't know what's going through his mind.”"

This is “the resistance” that they so proudly boast.\n\nThe upside down red triangle is a Hamas symbol used to designate their intended target — it’s an assassin’s target marking.\n\nSo all in all — the car is an all-out celebration of Palestinian terrorism. They’re calling for terrorism. In New York."

A photo of the figure was published, and it was obvious that the Hebrew word \"David\" was next to the figure, and it was a synagogue that was uncovered, not a church. \n\nWhen Israel took over Gaza in 1967, they went to the site - and found that the Gazans had gouged out David's face and other parts of his body.\n\nit is hardly the only time Palestinians have deliberately destroyed Jewish heritage objects. \n\n(The mosaic has since been restored.)"

        "text": "Well, what can be said about the current desperate move of Palestinian propaganda?\n\nWe have long moved beyond the sphere of national conflict, and now we're deeply immersed in full-throttle, exemplary Jew hatred.\n\nNot only is it a particularly devilish lie, but it's also completely implausible since there were hardly any Jews in America at that time. (less than 0.1% of the general population)\n\nMost of them arrived late 19th or early 20th century and were poor immigrants who settled in the cities mainly East Coast. \n\nThis new blood libel of the Palestinians' Goebbels-like propaganda is yet another pitiful attempt to harness minority communities with a history of oppression for their cause. They aim to create a narrative that Jews are a shared historical villain.\n\nPersonally, I'm glad they've brought it up, as it presents an excellent opportunity to discuss the history of Arabs as slave traders.\n\nAnd what a GLORIOUS history that is!\n\nThe scope of the Arab slave trade was extensive, lasting over a millennium from the 7th to the 20th century. \n\nEstimates suggest that millions of slaves were traded, but the exact numbers are debated among historians due to the trade's long duration and vast geographical spread.\n\nThis trade had a broad geographical reach, with slaves being sourced from various regions including Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and Asia. \n\nThese slaves were then integrated into different sectors of society, serving roles in agriculture, domestic service, military, administration, and even as mistresses.\n\nThe trade routes played a crucial role in the spread and maintenance of this trade. The most prominent among these were the Trans-Saharan route leading to North Africa, the Red Sea route to the Arabian Peninsula, and the Indian Ocean route.\n\nThese routes facilitated the extensive movement of slaves, deeply influencing the cultures and societies involved.\n\nThis trade left a significant impact on the racial and social structures of the Arab world. The cultural repercussions of this trade are profound and lasting, with its effects still discernible in modern societies. \n\nThe Arab slave trade eventually began to decline in the 19th century. This was largely due to increasing global movements against slavery and significant changes in the economic and political landscapes worldwide. \n\nThis trade's decline and eventual end came in the 20th century and marked a significant shift in global attitudes towards slavery and human rights.\n\nSo, yeah..."

        "text": "No, the modern state of Israel didn't magically come into being in 1948. No, Jews did not just show up in Israel in 1948. No, Israel was not a gift given to the Jews by colonial powers. No, Israel did not arise because of the Holocaust or in response to the Holocaust. No, the UN did not create the modern state of Israel.\n\nThe modern state of Israel was built and created SOLELY BY JEWS, over a period of almost 100 years, using Jewish capital , Jewish ingenuity, Jewish diplomatic efforts  and  Jewish military power. \nJews have lived in the Land of Israel , almost continuously, for 3,000 years. In  the years immediately preceding the approval of the  Mandate of Palestine by the League of Nations , over 100,000 Jews lived in the Land of Israel.\nRishon Le-Zion, Zichron Ya'akov, Petach Tikvah and Rosh Pina were established prior to 1904\nAgricultural schools were also established  around this time  and some of the students of these institutions went on to found kvutzot , the first of which was established at Degania on the Sea of Galilee in 1909.\nTel Aviv was founded in 1909.\nTechnion – Israel Institute of Technology ,Israel’s first university, was founded in 1912, 36 years before Israel’s Declaration of Independence. The Technion is credited with conceiving, founding and shaping the high-tech nation of the modern State of Israel.\nThe Hebrew University was founded in Jerusalem in 1918.\nThe principle of Jewish self-help was extended to the area of defense with the creation of \"HaShomer\", the Watchman, an association of Jewish guards set up in 1909 to defend Jewish settlements.\nTen years later,  the Histadrut became a powerful and unique institution. Not only did it serve as a trade union, defending the interests of the workers in Mandatory Palestine, but it was also constituted as \"Hevrat haOvdim\" (The Workers' Company), a holding company that owned several large corporations. Thus the Histadrut represented labor while it was in effect one of the largest employers in the Yishuv. The Histadrut also ran the largest \"Kupat Cholim\" (Sick Fund) as well as a vocational school system (Amal), daily newspaper (Davar), publishing company (Am Oved), sports club (HaPoel) and youth movement (HaNoar HaOved), to name only a few of the Histadrut's many activities.\nIn the same period,  elections were held for the \"Asefat Nivcharim\", the National Assembly of the Jews of Mandatory Palestine. The assembly elected a 36 member executive body known as the \"Va'ad Leumi\" (National Council), which represented the interests of Palestinian Jewry to the British authorities.\n\nBy 1939, before one-third of world Jewry was destroyed in the Holocaust, a geographic and demographic nucleus for a Jewish state was present in Mandatory  Palestine. By that date, more than 500,000 Jews and almost 75%  of all the land Jews would purchase by 1948 were already in Jewish hands.\n\nThe Jews had built their  state and created all the civic organizations necessary to run their state well before WW2. Again, by 1939 the modern state of Israel existed in all respects but for independence."

In fact, Great Britain reneged on the Balfour Declaration almost immediately after GB was awarded the Mandate of Palestine.\n🚨Every single country in the Levant was created under the same mandate system .\n🚨The Jews built  all the infrastructure , civic organizations etc. and had established a state in every sense of the word but international recognition by 1939. In fact, the Jews had acquired more than 25% of the land they  ultimately owned  in 1948 by 1925. \n🚨As reflected in the anti Zionist Peel commission report, the Jews rid the area of malaria, made the desert bloom and turned a forgotten, backwater shithole of the Ottoman Empire into a thriving , productive country that benefitted both Jews and Arabs.\n🚨 Although the Mandate of Palestine explicitly stated  that ONLY THE JEWS had the right to sovereignty in Mandatory Palestine, the Jews were willing to comprise and bent over backwards to reach a peaceful resolution with the Arabs. The Arabs rejected two offers of statehood --in 1937 (Peel commission offer) and 1947 ( UNGA resolution 181).\n🚨Instead of compromising, the Arabs first waged a civil war against the Jews, bringing in THOUSANDS of Arabs , armed by the British, from surrounding Arab states to attack the Jews.\n🚨When the Arabs' civil war failed, the surrounding Arab states waged a war of annihilation against the Jews. Despite being armed, trained and funded by the British, Americans and others, these Arab armies lost their war and the state of Israel emerged!\n\nThe pathetic cries of victimhood by the 8th generation descendants of Arabs who waged these wars, fled  prior to the wars, or were forced to flee as a direct result of these wars their ancestors started ,is beyond tiresome and pathetic.

(And I can tell you, most Palestinian prisoners leave Israeli jails better educated and heavier than when they arrived.)\n\nSo, even though it has already been debunked, they shamelessly return to it because they couldn't find anything else to support their lies… \n\nCould there be anything more pathetic than this?"

It's a story about a loving husband and wife who set out to celebrate life at a festival of peace. When the terrorists came to them, while they were trapped, Naji wrote to his brother: \"Take care of the children, I love you\", Gal sent a last WhatsApp message to her family: \"You don't understand\" and they really didn't understand, nobody understood. What happened in the following minutes is a holocaust, it is beyond imagination, it is beyond what words can describe. Gal was raped by the monsters. Gal went through the greatest suffering, after the rape they continued to torture her and set her on fire while she was still alive. Her charred body was found lying on the road with her hand shielding her face. She was identified after a week and Naji was identified a day after her, they were buried side by side. Gal and Naji, the wonderful parents who only that night lovingly put their two sons to sleep with kisses, closed their eyes themselves in the morning on the road of death, after hours of suffering and severe torment. This is a story about Gal and Naji, a story I wish never had to be told, the good Gal and Naji who went through hell, are now in heaven."

A photo of the figure was published, and it was obvious that the Hebrew word \"David\" was next to the figure, and it was a synagogue that was uncovered, not a church. \n\nWhen Israel took over Gaza in 1967, they went to the site - and found that the Gazans had gouged out David's face and other parts of his body.\n\nit is hardly the only time Palestinians have deliberately destroyed Jewish heritage objects. \n\n(The mosaic has since been restored.)"

The Palestine concept served better than that of Greater Syria. It allowed the Arab leaders of Palestine to speak the same political language as the Zionists and the British. Rather than refer to some outside source of authority, they could claim sovereignty for themselves. In the process, they evolved from provincial notables into independent actors. Thus, tactical considerations caused the rapid rise of Palestinian nationalism.” — Daniel Pipes\n\nhttps://t.co/zZS3oa9jP5\n\nhttps://t.co/4XATVgZRFO",
