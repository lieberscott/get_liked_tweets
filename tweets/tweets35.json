Palestinian civilians are horribly victimized (tortured, maimed, imprisoned, murdered) by Hamas whenever they won't serve Hamas' murderous goals. \n\nIf you in the West screaming \"Palestine will be free\" actually gave a bent shit about Palestinian civilians, you'd be ending that with \"of Hamas.\" But so many of you, sickeningly, have never expressed one whit of concern for any oppressed Muslim anywhere (as I have with frequency!) until it provided perfect cover for publicly screaming Jew hatred. \n\nAction is character. Show you actually care about Palestinian civilians and read about the actual work of the @IDF via @LtColRichard and maybe even post the truth about Israel and the absolute heroic care with which Israel takes extraordinary measures to avoid civilian deaths...the likes of which are unseen in modern warfare and really any warfare. \n\nTry that for a change, instead of posting \"too good to check\" lies about Israel (which are usually truths about the savages repurposed).",

Saudi Arabia also understood that it couldn't twist West's arm economically through the oil boycott, which it ended in March 1974. The two Arab powers decided to sue for peace with #Israel and accept Israel's 1967 proposal of land-for-peace: Israel implements UNSC 242 by withdrawing to Armistice Line as it stood on June 4, 1967. Egypt and Syria would get their territory back, Palestinians would build their state on West Bank and Gaza. \nInstigated by crazy radicals like Iraq's Saddam Hussein, Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, and Syria's Assad, Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) met in Cairo in 1974, declared opposition to a final settlement per 242, said will take 1967 territory to build a Palestinian state, from which they would continue the struggle until they \"fulfilled the liberation of all the Palestinian soil as a first step toward total Arab unity\" (i.e. 22 states merging into one). \nThis PLO statement publicized the phrase \"All the Palestinian Soil,\" which was hard to chant in rallies, so the protesters came up with an equivalent: From water to water, Palestine [will always be] Arab. On posters, the two slogans merged into \"All the #Palestinian Soil, From the River to the Sea.\" These slogan mean the totaly elimination of Israel and its replacement with an Arab Palestine that merges into the Great Arab State (wishful thinking).\nThe most famous \"All Palestinian Soil\" was drawn as a cartoon by caricaturist Naji Al-Ali, a hand writing the word Palestine with a bullet on top of \"All the National Soil.\" \nFrom the River to the Sea has ONE meaning only: Destroy Israel and replace it by Palestine. If you say otherwise, you either don't know or know and lie."

The cost has turned out to be prohibitive for all Arabs and Iranians (because economies are on pause and societies militarized waiting for Palestine to be liberated). The timeline has turned out to be open-ended, which means that the war with Israel has become a lifestyle, not a policy with a goal, a timeline and an estimate of required resources.\nThere is no one who runs their household like the Arabs are running the Palestine issue. There is no one who runs their business like the Arabs are running the Palestine issue. Common sense must prevail. Surrender, unconditionally and immediately, to Israel and get whatever you can get, given everything at hand, regardless of your emotions. Once Arabs do that, their lives will improve immeasurably. Maybe then, good life will make them have higher stakes in peace than in this crazy violence fest that they've been living in over the past century, wherein -- almost always -- they have little to lose, and therefore never live and never let others live."
