That said, the IDF has a team of lawyers they use the lawyers to inform and give advice on any military action undertaken.\n\nTo conclude, although the list above is not a complete list the message is clear.

It is a hatred of the West that has been inculcated in these kids by various pseudo-Marxist idealogues, the hatred of Israel, and the Jews, is just a byproduct.
