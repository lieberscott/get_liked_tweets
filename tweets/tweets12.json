We want civilians to be protected in areas where Hamas is not already using them as human shields. \n\nIt is horrific that UN agencies have endangered them by funneling them into Hamas strongholds instead of facilitating their safe evacuation to the humanitarian zone. And it is horrific that UN agencies cannot bring themselves to condemn Hamas for shooting rockets at Israeli communities from out of the humanitarian zone. \n\nCivilians must be protected from Hamas. \n\nIronically, the only people encouraging the mass displacement of Gazans are those who falsely label most of them “refugees” and indulge their dreams of relocating into Israel through violent struggle, instead of living in peace alongside us."

The Quran clearly and unequivocally describes the mission of Jesus as one that took place among the Israelites. Show me where the Quran says Jesus was Palestinian.\nQuran 61:6 -- And when Jesus, son of Mary, said, “O children of #Israel! I am truly God’s messenger to you, confirming the Torah which came before me.\nQuran 61:14 -- O believers! Stand up for God, as Jesus, son of Mary, asked the disciples, “Who will stand up with me for God?” The disciples replied, “We will stand up for God.” Then a group from the children of #Israel believed while another disbelieved. We then supported the believers against their enemies, so they prevailed.",

A taxi driver who got to trust me said Israel had a public transport system, a good and affordable health system, and the Lebanese found good jobs in northern Israel. After Israel withdrew from south Lebanon in 2000 (and Hezbollah proclaimed victory), south Lebanon became an impoverished jungle.\nIn the video below, a Palestinian says Palestinian life is better under Israeli rule. But what would he know. Kids in US colleges know better about decolonization, free Palestine and antisemitism."

They said, for example, when they call in an air strike against a terrorist target, it takes forever to get clearance.  Why?  Because the IDF insists on making sure there are no innocent civilians around.  Did the US do this in World War 2?  Korea?  Vietnam? Iraq? Afghanistan? Of course not.  But Israel does and it puts our soldiers at risk.  But you know what?  The soldiers I spoke with said they wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nSo remember this when you read the Palestinian propaganda about Israel slaughtering innocents in Gaza.  War is hell and innocents will be hurt, but Israel is doing the best it can to avoid needless carnage while at the same time ridding the world of bestial terror."

For this physicians’ group to desecrate the Holocaust museum with their calls of a ceasefire (ie - for the Jewish nation to stop defending itself) is stomach churning."

His son was a \"photojournalist and filmmaker.\" \n\nHe is angry about Israel's \"occupation,\" neglecting to note that Israelis withdrew from Gaza in 2005. \n\nHe asks: \"Why can’t Palestinians be treated equally, like Israelis and all other peoples in the world? Why can’t we live in peace and have open borders and free trade?\"\n\nHe doesn't mention the massacre, mass rapes, and kidnapping of children that were carried out by Hamas on Oct. 10.

For this physicians’ group to desecrate the Holocaust museum with their calls of a ceasefire (ie - for the Jewish nation to stop defending itself) is stomach churning."

The clearest evidence of its aggression is its support for the crimes of genocide in Gaza, and depriving the Palestinian people of the right to live in their land.\n\n Our belief in peace and the sanctity of killing people and violating their rights is what prompted us to take military action to stop Israel’s crimes in Gaza. Instead of your government putting pressure on Israel to stop them, it formed a military coalition to attack Yemen.\n\n There is a war looming on the horizon between Yemen, which seeks to stop the crimes of genocide, and America, which seeks to protect its perpetrators.\n\n We are struggling to establish justice on earth, and our war is moral because our goal is to support the oppressed on earth, and we will not stop our military operations against Israel except by stopping its crimes in Gaza, no matter the sacrifices، and as we are advocates of peace, we are men of war.\n\n\"Houthis, houthy\""

Because, of the 13,000 Hamas rockets, 100% of those have been dumb: they do not have precision-guided munition. Nobody’s talking about that statistic.”\n\nMaj.
