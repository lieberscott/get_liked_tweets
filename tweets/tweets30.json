After leaving the course, Eden volunteered for the prestigious Sky Rider unit, which operates the UAVs that collect operational intelligence for combat units deep in enemy territory.\n\nEden served as a combat soldier and later as an officer. On October 7th, the female soldiers of the Nachal Oz military base awoke at 7am to the sounds of the base coming under attack. \n\nThe IDF spotters were almost all female, none were combat soldiers and were unarmed. Eden and four of her women, all combat soldiers, raced with them to the safe room with their handguns. Within a short time, the battle began inside of the base, right next to the safe room where the unarmed women huddled together.\n\nThe base's PA system called out \"Red Alert\" over and over, in reference to a rocket attack. Afterwards, the words \"Invasion, Invasion\" were heard instead.\n\nInside the safe room, Eden made eye contact with the armed soldiers, loaded her gun then cocked it. The soldiers followed her lead, a move that later changed the course of the battle.\n\nThe safe room had two entrances. Eden, who naturally assumed the role of battle leader in defending the room, took the left entrance and instructed the fighters to guard the right entrance.\n\nThe first terrorist attempted to come through the door on the right and was shot dead by the soldiers. It was clear that the terrorists would now try the other entrance. This would in turn create an opportunity to escape through the rear. Eden readied herself by the door and ambushed the terrorists as they entered, in order to hold them up and buy the others time to exit via the open door.\n\nWhen a group of terrorists charged with gunfire and grenades, they were met with suppressive fire from Eden and her handgun. These were golden seconds, precious moments that allowed six unarmed spotters and the four combat soldiers to escape unscathed to the barracks, where they stayed until an IDF force arrived to liberate them. \n\nEden fell in battle, and in so doing she saved the lives of ten other women serving as IDF soldiers.\n\nEden, your country salutes you."

        "text": "One of the biggest and lesser known stories of Nov 29 is that the lands allocated to a Jewish state (two color map) were essentially those the Zionists reclaimed from malaria through land purchase, science and education (blue map). \nMoreover, the sudden and extremely rapid increase of the Arab population in the 1920‚Äôs and 1930‚Äôs in this barely populated backwater region (this was the highest population increase rate in the world in 1931/2) was only in part due to immigration spurred by Zionist development of the land. The major share of the massive Arab population increase was thanks to Malaria eradication, which was the work of the Galician born famed microbiologist and ardent Zionist Dr. Israel Kligler (credit to the great historical work of Anton Alexander). \nWith this knowledge it remains even a greater tragedy that the now much more numerous Arabs of the land directed their efforts towards brutally fighting Zionism rather than choosing to live side by side with an emerging Jewish state. \nIn the shadow of the Oct 7 massacre we mark once more the Nov 29 moment when the Jews said yes to the UNGA plan of partition (having prioritized having a state, even if tiny and mostly desert and lands reclaimed from malaria and no Zion and no Judea) and the Arabs said no and proceeded to wage a brutal war to the present day (having prioritized - still - the goal of the Jews not having a state at all and of any size). \n\n(Note on map titles: for twenty centuries, before a camoaign of denial was underway, it was well understood that the name ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù merely denoted the geographic region where the Land of Israel was and was therefore deeply associated with Jews and the their continuous connection to the land. Hence the League of Nation in establishing the mandate recognized the ‚Äúhistorical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine\" as the \"grounds for reconstituting their national home in that country‚Äù and which is why the Palestine Philharmonic Orchestra of Jewish musicians became the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra‚Ä¶)"

This is what pro-Hamas activists in the West describe as ◊¥open air prison◊¥ or \"concentration camp\". Gaza was neither of those. \nThe \"siege\" that Israel and Egypt imposed on Gaza was designed to prevent the smuggling of weapons into Gaza. Everything else was given free pass, even hundreds tons of cement entered Gaza just to be exploited by Hamas to build its terror tunnels, instead of schools, hospitals or residential buildings.\n\nThe claims that Gaza was a concentration camp is intended to justify the Islamic terrorism of Hamas against innocent Jews.\n\nAsk yourself: if the people of Gaza were really so poor, why did Hamas waste so many resources on its huge rocket arsenal and terror tunnels? How could they have an army of 40,000 terrorists (members of Hamas)?\n\nIsrael left Gaza in 2005. There was no reason for the Palestinians in Gaza to attack Israel after 2005. Unfortunately, Israel was mistaken in thinking that the Palestinians in Gaza wanted peace. Hamas did not come to power in Gaza by accident. The Palestinians knew very well that that Hamas would not bring economic prosperity or free welfare.\nThey knew that the Hamas wants war as its charter calls for the destruction of Israel and the genocide of Jews. This is why they voted for Hamas and still the majority of the Palestinian public supports Hamas.",
