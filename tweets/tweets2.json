But Yulia decided to stay and save lives. At 7:40 in the morning Yulia sent the first message to her commander: \"There are many gunshot wounds here in the area, some managed to escape, some reached us\". While the terrorists continued to shoot non-stop, Yulia concentrated on the task she had undertaken, and continued to correspond with her commander to direct forces to the festival grounds. She photographed dead, wounded and sent locations. Half an hour later, Yulia sent her commander a final message: \"Pray for me\". At 9:14 was the last conversation between the two, he asked her to hide under the bodies and pretend to be dead. She wrote to her husband: \"Take care of the children, I love you\". 20 minutes later she no longer answered. A trace of her cell phone showed that it was in Gaza. It's a story about the hardworking Yulia, who always took care of her parents and her home. This is a story about Yulia full of love. It is not known what happened to her in her last moments. Her phone is found in the field, burnt, Yulia was brutally murdered and identified thanks to tattoos of hearts with her children's names on her arm. This is a story about Yulia, a police officer, a mother, a fighter, a heroine."

        "text": "One of the 1,391 victims of the October 7 massacre was Hayim Katsman, a professor of philosophy and a D.J with the stage name Dr. 3abass. \nKatsman believed that playing Arabic music would promote understanding between the nations. In his free time, he volunteered to drive Palestinians from Gaza to receive medical treatment in Israel and helped Palestinians farmers near Mount Hebron. Like many of the residents of the Gaze Envelope, he believed that the war was between the governments, not the nations, that men like him would bring peace. He was deceived. \nIn many ways, Katsman is a typical victim of this massacre, aimed mostly at the most liberal and leftist communities in Israel, at the people who were the most on Gaza's side. This is the bitter irony of the Simchat Torah massacre."

The children beg the #HamasTerrorists not to take their dad, not to kill him. \n\n\"I love you, don't be a hero, be smart. Take care of yourself, and come back to me in one piece.” Gali screams as the #HamasRapists drag Tsachi away. \n\nMaayan is buried on October 22. \n\nThere aren't enough seats to hold the hundreds of mourners who arrive to remember her.\n\nYael and Shachar, at just 11 and 9, have seen such horrors that their small faces crumple into tears again and again. Their sister is dead, and their father isn't here to comfort them.\n\nThe mourners wear T-shirts with Tsachi and Maayan's pictures on the front. The words \"kidnapped father\" and \"murdered daughter\" appear above their faces, family photos from a happier time. \n\nOn the reverse is a simple and powerful message, \"bring Tsachi back\".\n\nOver 104 days later, and the nightmare suffered by the Idan family hasn’t ended. \n\nTsachi is still a hostage in #Gaza, suffering untold horrors. \n\nHe doesn’t even know if his family is alive. \n\nHis family can’t properly mourn Maayan, because they are fighting to save Tsachi and the other 134 hostages. \n\nMeanwhile #HamasRapists - and their pro-terror supporters around the world - have celebrated this unimaginable cruelty and barbarism, promising to commit the atrocities of Oct 7 “over and over again.”\n\nThis isn’t about Jewish vs Muslim. This isn’t about Israeli vs Palestinian. This fight is about Humanity vs the savage evil of Islamic Jihad. \n\nWhere do you stand? \n\nEnd 🧵\n\n#October7Massacre \n#BringThemHomeNow \n#NeverAgainIsNow \n#BelieveIsraeliWomen \n#IStandWithIsrael",
