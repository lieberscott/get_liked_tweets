          "text": "In this Al-Jazeera interview, Sami al-Arian concisely summarized the mainstream understanding of the conflict against Zionism shared by all modernist Islamists, Arabists, and many American progressives and liberals. Basically, Israel's main function in the Middle East works as a forward base of international capitalism/Western hegemony/American imperialism to prevent Arab societies from developing their democratic potential condemning the Middle East into a life of despotism, dehumanization, tyranny, and lack of human rights which facilitated Western control of the region. The presence of Israel acts as a political and economic spoiler, ensuring the region is constantly in a state of conflict, lack of cooperation, under-development, and militancy that produces endemic instability that justifies the rule of unaccountable dictators. The unaccountable dictators act as agents of extraction, cooperating with Israel to maintain the status quo and helping the US to extract strategic and economic concessions and resources from the region. This power structure, maintained by the triad of imperialism, Zionism, and Arab reaction, is then presented to everyone as a natural order which requires realism in opposing any democratic beginnings in the Middle East.\n\nThis narrative is a contemporary rendition of the Arab Nationalist conception of its struggle against Zionism, which in itself was built on the Leninist analysis of imperialism. The modern modification of it consists primarily in centralizing it on the concept of democratization. That is, the earlier version maintained that Israel's imperialist function was to consolidate and solidify the regional power structure preventing Arab unity, now modified to be preventing democracy, liberalism, and human rights. The issue of Palestinian human rights, as al-Arian said, is secondary at best.\n\nNotably, the underlying assumption of this nice fairy tale is that democracy is something that can be granted or withheld by the United States or Israel. But this assumption only makes sense of one has Marxian globalist perspective of international relations, which is the dominant paradigm today globally. When the Abraham Accords were signed, the same argument, albeit modified in American liberal form, was made by Shadi Hamid and Peter Beinart, who denounced the  Abraham Accords as an agreement to authoritarianism and went on to blame Israel for the absence of democracy in the Middle East. Academically, this is the dominant paradigm taught in most Middle East studies and international relations programs around the country and it was around which Marc Lynch, for instance, built the grad class I took with him.\n\nA casual outcome of such a pathetic attempt at analytical sophistication, an attempt that is more of a deceleration of authorized truths rather than an actual analysis of anything real, is the complete criminalization of Zionism and Israel, not merely as a powerful inconsiderate party in a territorial conflict but as a historical criminal on a universalist scale. By virtue of breathing every day, Israelis help cause the misery of hundreds of millions in Algeria, Cairo, Libya, Sudan, Yemen, etc. Arab professors, such as al-Arian, would say as much. American liberal and progressive professors would try to obscure that this is the logical conclusion of what they believe."

          "text": "Tonight, @Penn President Liz Magill signaled that one of our nation's most prestigious institutions is willing to abandon its commitment to freedom of expression.\n\n“For decades, under multiple Penn presidents and consistent with most universities, Penn’s policies have been guided by the Constitution and the law,” explained Magill in a video posted to X. \n\nBut now, she continued, the university “must initiate a serious and careful look at our policies,” a process to start “immediately.”\n\nThis is a deeply troubling, profoundly counterproductive response to yesterday's congressional hearing on “Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism.”\n\nWere Penn to retreat from the robust protection of expressive rights, university administrators would make inevitably political decisions about who may speak and what may be said on campus. \n\nSuch a result would undoubtedly compromise the knowledge-generating process free expression enables and for which universities exist.\n\nTo be clear: Universities will not enforce a rule against \"calls for genocide\" in the way elected officials calling for President Magill's resignation think they will. \n\nDissenting and unpopular speech — whether pro-Israeli or pro-Palestinian, conservative or liberal — will be silenced.\n\nConservatives like Rep. Elise Stefanik should ask themselves: \n\nDo you honestly believe this rule won’t be weaponized to ban an Israeli cabinet official from speaking at Penn? An Israeli Defense Force soldier?\n\nThe power to censor always invites abuse and never stays cabined.\n\nFIRE was founded in the wake of the infamous 1993 “Water Buffalo” incident at Penn. \n\nIn that case, Israeli-born Jewish student Eden Jacobowitz was charged with harassment for shouting “Shut up, you water buffalo” at a group of rowdy sorority students outside his dorm room window. \n\nThe sorority students were black, and the argument was that “water buffalo” was a racial epithet.\n\nBut it was not. \n\nJacobowitz, who speaks Hebrew, explained that water buffalo is a rough English translation of “behema,” a Hebrew slang term for a loud, rowdy person. \n\nThe story captured headlines, and Penn was widely condemned for its persecution of Jacobowitz.\n\nFIRE co-founder Alan Charles Kors, a history professor at Penn, helped advise Jacobowitz. \n\nThe charges were eventually dropped and the story would go on to serve as the opening chapter of “The Shadow University: The Betrayal Of Liberty On America's Campuses” — the book that launched FIRE.\n\nOver the years, Kors and FIRE helped Penn get past the water buffalo debacle. \n\nThe school reformed all of its speech codes and was one of the first universities to earn FIRE’s highest, “green light” rating for speech-protective policies.\n\nBut in recent years, Penn has backtracked. \n\nIt’s no longer a green light school. \n\nIt adopted new harassment policies that are ripe for abuse. \n\nAnd what free speech and academic freedom protections remain, it doesn’t consistently follow.\n\nNow President Magill suggests an institutional willingness to abandon free expression altogether.\n\nThis will not end well. \n\nVesting administrators like Magill with more power to police speech will result in more Jacobowitzes. \n\nThe intended targets for these codes will not be the actual casualties — and Penn students, faculty, alumni, and donors will come to regret the day they ever entrusted campus bureaucrats with the power to police speech on campus.",
