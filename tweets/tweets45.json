        "text": "Why the Gaza ground invasion is necessary:\n\nWhat people need to understand from Israel's perspective is that this is a cost calculation. \n\nUntil October 7th, the calculation in Israel was that Israel was  that the country was better off putting up with occasional attacks and rocket volleys. That they were better off trying to encourage a better situation in Gaza with work visas, providing electricity, providing water etc. Even if the actual government of Gaza was doing nothing to help the situation and often undermining it. Those were efforts to avoid war.\n\n Having kids grow up running to bomb shelters or fearing a random shooting or knife attack isn't a small price, but it was better than a full war. \n\nThat equation changed on October 7th. When thousands of your people are tortured, raped, taking hostage or murdered by the group you allowed to stock up on weapons and plan because you avoided taking action for years, that choice is no longer available. Hamas took it away. War is here. \n\nAt the time of the attack, Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza were still technically in a ceasefire from the last attack earlier in 2023. Those calling for Israel to just abandon their hostages and allow Hamas to continue to restock weapons and prepare another attack are vounteering for Israelis to pay the price without asking them. \n\nNo country would ever accept such an attack without taking out the group responsible and ensuring it can't happen again. No other country would be expected to do so. There is no doubt that  Israel's actions in Gaza will have costs for years to come, but there is no choice now. Hamas cannot be allowed to continue to stock up weapons, plan attacks, and terrorize Israelis. So the only choice now is victory or surrender.\n\nWe should pray for a swift victory with as little collateral damage as is possible."
