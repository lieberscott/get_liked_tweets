One of many Arab on Arab killings that have taken place in Israel this year. Many, like the goon from 5Pillars and other big accounts, have left their tweets up, as it still generates anger and hatred towards the Jews, even though it’s false.\n\nBut Swindon and Lowkey have done worse. They simply erased her. Now they know it’s not the Jews who are responsible, they both quietly deleted their tweets and went about their day. This woman and her dead foetus are no longer worthy of their attention. The pregnant woman was a useful toy when they could blame the Jews. Now it appears she was killed by her own, this Arab woman is both literally and ideologically dead to them.\n\nIt’s never really about Palestinians, Arabs or the victims with Jew-haters. It’s about the Jew as the perpetrator. Otherwise, it’s not worth their time."

They claimed to only be “Anti-Zionist” and yet within years of Anti-Zionism becoming a defining feature of Arab societies no Jews were left across the Arab world. \nAs we mark on Nov 30 the ethnic cleansing of Jews from the Arab world, with the knowledge that the only difference between Europe in the 1930’s and 1940’s is that the Jews of the Arab world had an Israel to go to, I’m sharing a harrowing piece by my colleague Adi Schwartz on “The Iraqi Dreyfus”, Shafiq Adas, who was hung by the Iraqis for “Zionism” despite being as far from it as possible (because that’s how Anti-Zionism works, it begins by saying it’s not about Jews, and then Jews are blamed for “Zionist sympathies”…)\nPS And that’s why when Arab countries like the UAE drop Anti-Zionism they also become hospitable to Jewish life. \nhttps://t.co/hMxMI0Pzi8"

For 6 months Zahle endured intense shelling and was completely cut off from the outside world.\n\nThe Lebanese Christian diaspora held prostests and demonstrations calling for humanitarian aid and a ceasefire, and even Pope John Paul II called for the stop of the onslaught. But the Syrians and Palestinians were determined in finishing what they started.\n\nBut after months of destruction, death, blood, and tears, the Lebanese Christian resistance, despite being greatly outnumbered, somehow miraculously defeated the Syrians and Palestinians. The city was completely destroyed, but the population started rebuilding the city as soon as the invaders were expelled.\n\nBelow is a picture of Our Lady of Zahle overlooking the city."
