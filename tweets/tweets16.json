The problem was that Eichmann didn't want a potentially strong Jewish state, which he thought could become a threat to the Nazis. But the Zionists tried to save them. That's not collaboration, that's trying to make a deal with those holding hostages, in this case the entire Jewish population of Germany. And your own example, with Eichmann rejecting the idea as too good for the Jews and dangerous for the Nazis, is counter to the Soviet propaganda notion that the Nazis were \"Zionists.\""

So I have this to say to you. \n\nIsrael is not a colonialist state – it’s a refugee state which was literally decolonized from Britain. \n\nThe majority of Israeli Jews are people of color, whose families were ethnically cleansed from other parts of the Middle East.\n\nThroughout history, the only indigenous sovereign entities to exist in the land have been Jewish states. \n\nJews originate from the land, derive our religion and our practices from it and despite centuries of exile and displacement have always kept an unbroken presence there. \n\nAnd you Greta Thunberg, are chanting “crush Zionism” on the streets of Sweden. \n\nZionism is the Jewish people exercising our right to self-determination in some parts of our only historic, ancestral and indigenous homeland. \n\nHamas showed us on October 7 what “crushing Zionism” looks like and you want to cheer that on Greta?\n\nGreta Thunberg, if I can borrow your famous phrase, “how dare you!”\n\nBut this is how antisemitism works – Find what is most evil to you, and blame it on the Jews, or today - on the Jewish state. \n\nI can understand that younger generations in western societies feel guilty about the evils of colonialism. \n\nBut Israel’s history is not your history, and whatever guilt you feel, supporting the massacre of Jews in their ancestral land will not wash away the sins of your fathers. When your ancestors were colonizing the world, my ancestors were being slaughtered by Cossacks. \n\nWe were dreaming – next year in Jerusalem – of building a life raft in our homeland. We fled genocidal violence in Europe. We were ethnically cleansed from Arab countries all over the Middle East. And we built a liberal, democratic Jewish state. That is not a colonial enterprise. \n\nZionism is not a colonial enterprise – Zionism is the decolonization movement of the Jewish people. \nAnd to anyone who cannot accept our presence or who slanders Israel as something it is not, we are here to say: “how dare you.”"

Hamas had full control of the hospital, including holding hostages (consistent with released hostage testimony) and setting up their own offices/phone lines.\n\nTellingly, he says they used the hospital as a base (a war crime) bc they knew they wouldn’t be targeted there. He admits Hamas also used ambulances to transport themselves (another war crime). \n\nPls note that WHO and UN personnel have been in and out of that hospital for years and said nothing as it was set up in this way, this creating the current situation. It’s also worth noting that Qatar-controlled Al Jazeera used this same guy as a primary source in several articles over last month."

        "text": "Martin Indyk represents everything that is awful about the Oslo process: the inability of its professional proponents to admit their mistaken assumptions even when they have been disolved in oceans of Jewish blood. Neither the 2nd Intifada, not even Oct. 7th and the PA's celebration of it, will change their prescription.  It is like a medieval panacea, prescribed regardless of the patient's condition. There is no future situation that would lead them to say, \"OK, this was a bad idea, lets forget about it.\" When their messiah does not arrive, they just tinker with the doctrine and say its not time YET. Why would Israel want to entrust its future to them?"

[that] the new toxic discussion taking place primarily in the United States [emphasizing the whiteness of Jews] is designed to label Jews as ‘white supremacists.’”\nThose young Americans and Europeans out on the streets calling for the elimination of the Jews from their homeland see as the racialized minority the Muslim, the follower of a religion founded by another white people, the Arabs, the actual majority in the region where Jews have for millennia made their home. The actual minority in the region, the Jew, driven from Arab lands, seven million living in a space one-fifth the size of the state of Kentucky, becomes a colonizer in his own land. In the strange alchemy of social justice, Jews become the bad guys. Antisemitism finds its dissimulation in the jargon of post-colonial ideology.\"\n\nhttps://t.co/Br4e3LHcHP",
