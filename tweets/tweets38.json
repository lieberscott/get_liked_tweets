She slams all the Islamists who justify violence against Jews and Christians by using their victim status as a justification for their actions: ◊¥The Jews have come from the tragedy (of the Holocaust), and forced the world to respect them, with their knowledge, not with their terror, with their work, not their crying and yelling. Humanity owes most of the discoveries and science of the 19th and 20th centuries to Jewish scientists. 15 million people, scattered throughout the world, united and won their rights through work and knowledge. We have not seen a single Jew blow himself up in a German restaurant. We have not seen a single Jew destroy a church. We have not seen a single Jew protest by killing people. But the Muslims...◊¥\n\nLink to the video: https://t.co/BGZ1Np4Co6"

        "text": "Hi, lawyer here again. You‚Äôve heard Israel has a right to \"self-defense,\" but you may have noticed politicians & media stars disagree on what Israel is permitted to do in #SelfDefense. Want to know how international law really defines the limits of ‚Äúself-defense?‚Äù Then read on.\n\n‚ÄúSelf-Defense‚Äù Under International Law\n\nSelf-defense is the most basic legal right afforded to all sovereign nations.\n\nUnder both customary international law & Article 51 of the #UN Charter, all countries acknowledge one another‚Äôs ‚Äúinherent right‚Äù to self-defense against armed attack.\n\nYou may hear some claim Israel‚Äôs self-defense is limited to what he or she claims is ‚Äú#proportionate‚Äù to the #HamasMassacre of October 7-only. That is incorrect.\n\nIsrael‚Äôs right to self-defense under international law continues until it has eradicated the ongoing threat of further attacks by #Hamas.\n\nWhy? Well, the #October7massacre was only the latest & most deadly #TerroristAttack by Hamas against Israel.\n\nHamas‚Äô Goals Stated in its Charter\n\nFor anyone paying attention, Hamas does not hide its intentions. Its raison d‚Äô√™tre is expressly stated in its 1988 Charter, which includes the following (just a few examples):\n\n(1) Hamas is in a worldwide religious ‚Äústruggle against the #Jews‚Äù;\n\n(2) Hamas intends to ‚Äúraise the banner of #Allah over every inch of Palestine‚Äù (‚Äúfrom the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea‚Äù) where it plans an Islamic Caliphate; and\n\n(3) Hamas vows no #peace with Israel, claiming ‚ÄúPalestine is an #Islamic land.‚Äù\n\nHamas‚Äô Early Attempts to Thwart Peace with Terror\n\nHamas has been carrying out terror attacks against Israeli civilians for ~35 years.\n\nTo help kill the 1993 & 1995 ‚ÄúOslo Accords‚Äù in the cradle, Hamas carried out & celebrated multiple terror attacks, just a few of which include:\n\n(1) Oct 19, 1994: suicide bomber murdered 22 Israeli civilians & wounded 56 on a public bus in Tel Aviv;\n\n(2) Feb 25, 1996: suicide bomber murdered 26 Israeli civilians & wounded 80 on a public bus in Jerusalem; and\n\n(3) Feb 25-March 4, 1996: three Hamas suicide bombings in seven days murdered 65 Israeli civilians & wounded 164 (two on public busses in Jerusalem & one in Tel Aviv‚Äôs largest shopping mall).\n\nCamp David 2000 & the Second Intifada\n\nAt Camp David in 2000, U.S. #President Bill Clinton hosted #Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak & Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to finalize a peace agreement.\n\nBarak accepted the \"Clinton Parameters\" & agreed to recognize a Palestinian state on 100% of the Gaza Strip & up to 97% of the #WestBank (with land swaps to make up for the remaining ~3%) with East #Jerusalem as its capital in return for ‚Äúthe end of belligerency and any further claims.‚Äù\n\nArafat rejected the offer.\n\nArafat made no counter offer.\n\nArafat, instead, ordered the Second #Intifada.\n\nArafat released dozens of Hamas & Islamic #Jihad terrorists from #Palestinian jails & made a strategic return to #terrorism.\n\nThe Second Intifada saw bloody, almost-daily terrorist attacks for ~five years, during which more than 1,000 Israeli civilians were murdered.\n\nIn fact, more than 200 terror attacks were carried out against Israeli civilians between May 2003-July 2004 alone.\n\nThe constant terror - especially in response to Israel‚Äôs offer of peace & a Palestinian state - left scars on Israeli society that remain to this day.\n\n2005 - Israel Withdrew from Gaza Entirely & Hamas Took Over\n\nIsrael believed it had no \"peace partner\" in the PA, so Prime Minister Ariel Sharon adopted a ‚Äúdisengagement plan‚Äù from #Gaza in 2005, which saw Israel forcibly remove 9,000 Israelis living in 21 Jewish settlements in Gaza and dismantle 38 synagogues, 42 daycare centers, 36 kindergartens, seven elementary schools, and three high schools at a total cost of ~$900 million. Israel even dug up all Jewish graves and moved them out of Gaza.\n\nThere was no #siege & no #blockade - Gaza was under the complete control of the PA.\n\nBut here is a general overview of the unfortunate two years post-disengagement:\n\nSept 12, 2005: not a single Jew - alive or dead - was left in Gaza; PA took control.\n\nSept 23, 2005: Hamas fired 40 rockets at Israeli civilians in Sderot.\n\nJan 25, 2006: PA Legislative elections resulted in a Hamas victory.\n\nMarch 29, 2006: Hamas formed PA government under arch-terrorist Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nJune 25, 2006: Hamas terrorists crossed from Gaza into Israel, murdered two, wounded two, & kidnapped Gilad Shalit.\n\nFeb 8, 2007: Hamas and Fatah (PA President Mahmoud #Abbas‚Äô organization) agreed to share power; Hamas reiterated it would ‚Äúnever‚Äù recognize Israel.\n\nJune 10-14, 2007: Hamas murdered or exiled every Fatah member from Gaza in a bloody coup.\n\nOnce the #genocidal Hamas terror organization completed it takeover of Gaza, both Israel & #Egypt (which also shares a border with Gaza) placed a ‚Äúblockade‚Äù on Gaza that attempted to restrict smuggling of weapons & terrorists.\n\nHamas Terror & Israeli Responses\n\nAfter Hamas fired more than 10,000 rockets & mortars at Israeli civilians, Israel launched Operation Cast Lead in 2008; but international pressure forced Israel to end the operation with a ‚Äústalemate‚Äù #ceasefire instead of destroying Hamas.\n\nIn 2012, after Hamas continued to rain thousands of rockets on Israeli civilians, Israel launched Operation Pillar of Defense; but international pressure forced Israel to end the operation with a ceasefire.\n\nIn 2014, Hamas was still firing thousands of rockets on Israeli civilians, and Israel launched Operation Protective Edge; again, international pressure forced Israel to end its operation with a ceasefire.\n\nIn 2021, Hamas fired six rockets on Jerusalem (an Israeli ‚Äúred line‚Äù) and then fired hundreds of rockets aimed at Israeli civilian population centers, including #TelAviv. Israel launched Operation Guardian of the Walls; but, again, international pressure forced Israel to end its operation with a ceasefire.\n\nOct 7, 2023: ~3,000 Hamas terrorists & their collaborators infiltrated Israel & committed mass atrocities including mutilations, rapes, torture, & murder of Israeli men, women, children, the elderly, the infirm, & infants. More than 1,200 Israelis were murdered, ~8,000 were wounded, and ~240 were kidnapped.\n\nExtent of Israel‚Äôs Legal Right to Self-Defense\n\nIsrael‚Äôs legal right to self-defense permits it to do everything ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù to ensure Hamas can never attack Israeli civilians again.\n\nAt a minimum, this is because of: (1) the genocidal brutality of Oct 7; (2) Hamas‚Äô history of genocidal warfare against Israel & Jews; and (3) Hamas‚Äô express commitment to repeat massacres like Oct 7 ‚Äúover and over.‚Äù\n\nThus, Israel‚Äôs right to ‚Äúself-defense‚Äù extends beyond just stopping Hamas‚Äô immediate attacks (it still fires rockets daily at Israel), it permits Israel to completely eradicate Hamas‚Äô military capability.\n\nOne way to think of how/why it is ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù for Israel to destroy Hamas‚Äô military capability in self-defense is to understand countries not only have the right to eliminate threats to their civilian population, but they also have the right to restore a sense of security.\n\nOn October 7, Hamas shattered Israel‚Äôs sense of security since Hamas showed it had the capability to defeat Israel‚Äôs defensive measures.\n\nIsrael had invested heavily in defensive-only military capabilities such as building the #IronDome system that intercepts the majority of rockets fired from Gaza & by constructing bomb shelters across the country.\n\nHowever, on October 7, Hamas got around Israel‚Äôs defenses & carried out a genocidal massacre.\n\nAs a result, Israel is legally justified under international law to take necessary action in self-defense by completely destroying Hamas‚Äô ability to make war or commit atrocities again by doing things such as: (1) capturing or killing Hamas‚Äô command & control; (2) destroying Hamas‚Äô combat capabilities by taking out operatives, launch sites, & military equipment; and (3) taking steps to prevent Hamas from reconstituting & rearming.\n\nOne additional thing to keep in mind with regard to Israel‚Äôs legal right to self-defense is the possibility that Israel could extend this right to #Iran given its role as the main sponsor of Hamas in both weapons and terror training.\n\nWhether Israel thinks it is a good idea to strike Iran directly remains to be seen; however, it is clear that Israel would be legally justified in doing so in order to stop Iran from funding attacks against its civilians.\n\n#Education #Israel #Palestine",
