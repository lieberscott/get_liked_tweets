        "text": "Free Palestine mob uses the word Occupation as a silver bullet, an argument to counter all arguments, that if Palestinians live under occupation, their misery is explained and their reaction to occupation, even if criminal, is justified under international law.\nNow the catch here is that the Free Palestine mob never specify which part of the land is exactly occupied. Those who wanted to put October 7 \"in context,\" mentioned 1948, just like those who celebrate nakba every year. If 1948 is the disaster, then Israel itself is the occupation (not the West Bank Israel captured from Jordan and Gaza it captured from 1967). \nUnder international law, Israel on 1948 is not an occupation. It is a sovereign state, recognized by the UN and over 150 countries. Arabs who live in Israel are Israeli citizens. If they have issues with the state, that's not occupation.\nNow the disputed 1967 land. Palestinians were never, throughout history, sovereign over this land or had a state there (for it to be occupied). Egypt and Jordan conceded 1967 landed to Israel in peace treaties and their status became disputed pending final agreement between Israelis and Palestinians. Israelis entered into 1993 Oslo Accord that partially conceded control to Palestinians on the way to a full state. Hamas suicide bombed the peace process during which Palestinians refused three offers to construct their state on 1967 land, insisting on demands that infringe on Israeli sovereignty (such as return of Palestinians to Israel or other issues).\nStill, Israel conceded more 1967 territories to Palestinians, in 2005, when it Israel shrank its control by handing Gaza strip over to the Palestinian authority, vacating settlements in Jenin and other spots in West Bank. Had Palestinians exploited Israeli withdrawal to build their state on the land they control, they could have expanded their state through agreements with Israel to get more of the occupied land. But what did Palestinians do? They elected Hamas, which calls 1948 land, Israel, occupation, and shouts from the River to the Sea Palestine will be Islamic Arab. Hamas missed a chance of creating a state by turning Gaza into a spot that just killed 1200 Israelis a month ago.\nSo when you say occupation, don't think that everyone would bend over backwards and take the rest of your arguments as being error proof."

I I’m now on the part  where Hamas threw her in prison for refusing to stop speaking up about Hamas’ mistreatment and theft of aid from the Gazan civilians they have left impoverished by stealing billions meant to better the lives of Palestinian families.  \n\nNot  a short interview but worth listening to in a way a few interviews are.  Amazing stuff. Palestinian woman telling it like it is, and damn, it’s ugly.  \n\nThis shows why @IDF is doing a huge service to the poor Palestinian people brutalized and murdered and left with nothing by Hamas.  \n\nAn amazing part of this is where she mentions that the people told her life was better when the Israelis actually “occupied” Gaza. \n\nThe people had work and pretty good lives and didn’t encounter the horrible brutality of Hamas. Those who remember these days really resent Hamas, she explains.  \n\nWow.\n\nInterview here with English translation embedded: https://t.co/ThzOk0EN4m",
