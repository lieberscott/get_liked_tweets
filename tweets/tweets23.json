Of course not. We will never love them. Absolutely not. The Jews are infidels – not because I say so, but because Allah said so [...] The Jews are the enemies of Muslims regardless of Palestine [...] This is it. We must believe that our fighting with the Jews is eternal [...] You must believe that we will fight, defeat, and annihilate them, until not a single Jew remains on the face of the Earth.\"\n\nIf you ever wondered why there is no peace in the Middle East, this video will give you the answer. Religious leaders in the Arab-Muslim world use radical Islamic rhetoric to promote war and hatred against Israel and the Jewish people. This incitement must be stopped!\n\nLink to the video: https://t.co/x69NaccgpY\n\nIt seems that Twitter is limiting the reach of my posts, so please if you see this post, hit the like button, retweet and even share your thoughts in the comments below about the video.

They are being used as pawns in the unending war to undo Israel's creation.\n\nShockingly though, UNRWA's budget is not funded by Israel's enemies. It is funded by Western governments.\n\nHere are the largest donors in 2022:\n\n🇺🇸 $344M\n🇩🇪 $202M\n🇪🇺 $114M\n🇳🇴 $34M\n🇯🇵 $30M\n🇫🇷 $29M\n\nLet's imagine for a moment that UNRWA teachers weren't teaching students to support terror and hate Jews.\n\nLet's imagine that UNRWA schools weren't being used to store rockets.\n\nLet's imagine that UNRWA teachers weren't holding hostages.\n\nEven in that world, it would be a moral imperative for donor countries to stop funding the system of delusion that UNRWA's founding has created for Palestinians, whereby they live for generations on Israel's doorstep, waiting for its destruction.\n\nDonor countries must find alternative organizations through which to deliver humanitarian aid to Gazans. \n\nThey must also create a system that aids voluntary resettlement for those Palestinians who decide to finally accept the truth: \n\nThe war has ended, Israel is there to stay.\n\nAnd it is time for UNRWA to go."

Beware of those who use their own family as shields, lurking in tunnels like rats.\n\nStay sharp as Hamas deploys so-called journalists as spies, glamorizing their terrorism, much like the narratives spun by Al Jazeera and Al-Arabi Al-Jadeed. They recruit children as soldiers and involve civilians in the theft of humanitarian aid – a playbook straight out of the ISIS saga in Iraq and Syria. Working with Hamas doesn't make you a journalist or a civilian; it makes you complicit in evil, camouflaging your filth with a facade.\n\nDon't be fooled by sympathizers trying to sugarcoat Hamas's heinous acts, despite damning video evidence – from rape to killing infants.

But martyr (shaheed) should not scare anyone?\nAlso, Allahu Akbar is two words not three. There is no masculine singular third person pronoun (hu) in the middle. The hu sound is the dammah over the h of Allah because it is at the beginning of the sentence (mubtada2). There is no confusion here, the words you mentioned are the battle cry in Islamic conquests, the name of war in Islam, the name of those killed. Intifada literally means uprising but between 2000 and 2005 meant Hamas suicide bombings killing Jews.\nAll these words religious war terminology and have no place in a modern peaceful discourse. I suggest you consult more with Arabic speakers. The only not wartime word would be inshallah."
