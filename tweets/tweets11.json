Her father shared her story with Israeli radio today: \"At 7:45am, she had a very brief conversation with us while we were in the shelter, with poor reception, and she said 'they are shooting at us, I am scared dad!'\" Only the next morning did her father see a video that Hamas posted, showing Agam being forcibly taken by Hamas men into Gaza.\n\nHer father said that news of her being alive came with the release of some of the hostages from captivity during the temporary ceasefire a few weeks ago, but the family is still in complete turmoil. \n\n\"The former hostages who returned to Israel share information that on one hand is positive, on the other hand is horrifying,” he noted. \"She is a young girl, 19 years old, among the youngest who remained there. I don't want to even think about what might be happening to her there. People who returned spoke of rape and sexual violence. I shut myself off and don't want to think about it - but we are anxious about her fate,\" he said.\n\nAt the end of the interview, Shlomi turned to his daughter, hoping his words would reach her: \"Agam, we miss you very much, waiting for you to come home, just come back, we love you, please be for us strong, we are here trying to be strong for you.\"\n\nBring them all home now."

(Ok, maybe a little.)\n\nI am not bothered by their hatred. \n\nWhat really scares me is how confidently they share their lies. \n\nNot a day goes by where I don’t ask myself “Does this psychopath really believe his lies or does he know he’s lying?”\n\nI mean, every single antisemitic trope in history has resurfaced and now that we live in an era of social media, those lies are reaching hundreds of millions of people. \n\nAnd the confidence…\n\nWhat haven’t these lunatics said?\n\n- Jews killed Jesus? ✔️\n\n- Jews are harvesting organs? ✔️\n\n- Jews control the world/media? ✔️\n\n- Jews are poisoning people✔️ (did we start drinking their blood yet or do I still have something to look forward to?)\n\n- Jews are so horrible and that’s why so many countries kicked them out? ✔️\n\n- Jews are committing genocide just like the Nazis did to them? ✔️ (this is a new one but it’s a doozy!)\n\n- Jews have double loyalty? ✔️\n\nI’m sure I’m missing many more but you get the point. The same lies as always. \n\nThe thing is, in 2023, it really doesn’t matter if something is even remotely true or not. What matters is how well the tweet/post is drafted and then how much traction it gets.\n\nThe confidence of the whole anti Israel/antisemitic (same thing…) is terrifying. \n\nThese people are not limited by anything. They can literally claim anything and if the lie is told well, it must be true. \n\nI’m terrified by this not only for the Jews who are the recipients of the resulting violence, but I’m also petrified for western civilization because when truth and critical thinking go out the window, the next step, which has already begun is total moral bankruptcy and then chaos. \n\nWhat can you do? You can stop taking antisemitic news as fact and do your research before hitting that RT button. \n\nWords matter. Truth matters. \n\nYour keyboard is now a weapon. Use it responsibly. Thanks in advance."

She continued driving without knowing where and reached the Kibbutz Bari junction where the young men asked her to get off and continue running. Adi saw a white van with terrorists and started driving in the area, for about 50 minutes she fought trying to get out of the place, the terrorists caught up with her, they shot her in the head and in the head of her friend and murdered them both. Adi was considered missing, her parents published their phone number and asked that if anyone saw her to inform them, the terrorists saw their phone number online and started calling them saying that the beautiful girls were with them and they were raping them while in the background the real abductees were screaming. But 5 days later the hard news came, Adi is in heaven now.\n#October7massacre\n#HamasMassacre"

        "text": "\"How can you support ISRAEL when it's pure evil? شر مطلق\"\n\nMy answer is: this opinion says more about YOU than about Israel. \n\nMy experience as an Israeli-Arab (some would call it Palestinian), is that we're being taught to hate Israel from young age. This is fueled by three factors: \n1-Ignorance, 2-Obsession, 3-Antisemitism.\n\n1-Ignorance: Arab societies, generally less educated, become susceptible to the manipulation of leaders with agenda. This includes the tendency to believe in conspiracy theories. The lack of understanding about History & Anthropology, and the universality of conflict, displacement, and warfare throughout human history distorts the perception of the Palestinian cause, making it appear uniquely exceptional and dramatic. \n\n2-Obsession: On top of general lack of historic knowledge, there's OVER knowledge about each and every detail of Israel's shortcomings, This hyper-awareness often leads to the misconception that events in Israel are unparalleled and are attributable to its identity as a country or a Jewish nation. For example, in the current war, those with limited knowledge of common warfare practices might be shocked by Israel's actions, such as the treatment of POWs, as they really believe it is unprecedented or irrational. \n\n3-Antisemitism: This allows them to believe conspiracy theories, that Israel is acting out of interest to control the world or purge any ethnicities around it, when the data on the ground doesn't support any of this. but the opposite. for instance: \"Israel wants to expand\" - when in fact Israel willingly relinquished and retreated from territory whenever peace was an option. \n\nIgnorance and Obsession are a golden duo in this case. Because it is well expected that if you dive deep into any country's news, you'll find enough instances of crime, corruption and expressions of racism. This is particularly true in the case of Israel, a democracy where citizens actively engage in self-critique, and the governance system operates with transparency. But when those flaws are gathered into one concentrated demonic piece of \"information\", it gives the haters the impression that they are looking into the eye of evil itself."

        "text": "https://t.co/lZ6Ism1yFD of the most important means by which UNRWA fulfilled its mission is inflating the number of Palestinians it registers as refugees. It does so by engaging in several unique practices, not applied to any other refugee population in the world: (1) Counting descendants of the original refugees displaced by the War of 1948 in perpetuity (by now into the fifth generation) automatically and with no qualifications; (2) Never removing any “refugees” from the count even if they acquired citizenship of another country, a status that for all other true refugees ends their refugee status; (3) Counting Palestinians who continue to live in the West Bank and Gaza, so in “Palestine” as refugees “from” Palestine. Once UNRWA’s inflationary practices are removed, almost none of the Palestinians who claim to be “refugees”, either as registered by UNRWA (around 5.7 Million) or self-claimed by Palestinians living in the West (a total of 8-9 Million) are actually refugees by any international standard. The vast majority of them are either (1) living in the West Bank and Gaza, and so clearly are not refugees “from” Palestine, still very much living there, and since almost all of them are by now second to fifth generation claimants they have also never been displaced by war - 2.2 Million; (2) Citizens of countries such as Jordan - 2.2 Million or various countries around the world - 2-3 Million. Citizens of countries are not refugees by any international standard. This leaves about 250,000 Palestinians who remain stateless in Syria and Lebanon, despite having been born there and never having been displaced by war. Those countries refuse to give them citizenship. They are certainly no longer refugees, but they are stateless. Of them, perhaps 30,000 are indeed refugees by international standards in that they were displaced by war, crossed the border and have not been given citizenship by any other country. Them, and only them, should be recognized as refugees. That is less than 1% of the total number of Palestinians who claim to be “refugees”. \n\nhttps://t.co/63JPimBQA3 addition to its inflationary practices, the UNRWA compounds (“Refugee Camps”) and schools are the incubators in which the Palestinian national ethos of “revenge and return” was created and shaped. It is the ground zero Palestinian political organization in that it daily reinforces the Palestinian ethos that the Jews have no right to a state in any of the territory between the Jordan River and the Sea, and that Palestinians will one day undo Israel by means of “return”.  Since the days of the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre, planned and perpetrated by UNRWA graduates, to the October 7th massacre by Hamas, also planned and perpetrated by UNRWA graduates (Muhammad Deif was raised in an UNRWA compound and studied in its school), UNRWA has sustained, nourished, educated and raised generation after generation of Palestinians dedicated to undoing Israel by “all means”, primarily violence and terror. Hamas, like Fatah before it, merely recruits UNRWA graduates ready to commit any atrocity in the name of “revenge and return”. It’s no coincidence that the two places where the perpetual refugee culture is strongest - Gaza and Lebanon - are also the most violent.\n\nIn short, why are there still millions of people claiming to be refugees from a war that ended more than seven decades ago? Because to the Palestinians, that war has never ended, and they continue to believe that one day, with enough patience and violence, they could still win it to achieve their original goal: no state for the Jewish people anywhere from “The River to the Sea”. \n(The full history is of-course available in “The War of Return: How Western Indulgence of the Palestinian Dream has Obstructed the Path to Peace”)."

        "text": "Why are there even places called “refugee camps” in Gaza? And why are two thirds of the people living in Gaza, who were born there and lived there their entire lives, called “refugees” from a war that ended more than seven decades ago? The answers to these question unlock the core of the conflict. Here they are (Part 1; Part 2 in the first comment):\n\n1.The 20th century has been marked by a transition from empires to states. We begin the 20th century when much of the world is divided between empires. We end it when much of the world is divided between states. When lucky, those states were based on the self determination of a people who share a common history, language, ethnicity, background religion and connection to a territory. (Zionism emerged in this context based on the idea of self determination for the Jewish people in the only territory to which they were ever connected as a people). When unlucky those new states were artificially created by receding empires drawing boundaries, forcing different peoples to share one state, leading almost always to civil war, dictatorship, or both. This transition has been bloody. It involved two world wars and numerous regional and civil wars. In the bloody process of empires receding and new states emerging to replace them, tens of millions of people were displaced, fleeing across newly created borders, typically to new countries with an ethnic makeup similar to their own. This was true of Hindus and Muslim, Ukrainians, Poles and Germans, Bulgarians, Greeks and Turks and Arabs and Jews. This was not unique.\n\n2.What was unique is that one group only of refugees from that time and those wars were allowed to maintain themselves as endless refugees in anticipation of one day winning a war they had lost. Those were the Arab refugees from the war of 1948, later to be known as Palestinians. All other refugee groups, except the Palestinians, were presented with a clear message: “it’s tough, it’s tragic, move on”. There was a clear understanding that in the most fundamental sense there is no going back - not in place and not in time (thus, there was no such thing as “a right of return”). To seek to go back would mean endless war. And so the message was forward looking and future facing. Tens of millions of refugees and displaced persons, among them millions of Jews, would build new lives in the new countries to which they fled.\n\n3.Except Palestinians. The war that the Arabs of the land and the surrounding countries waged to prevent a Jewish state from emerging and gaining independence failed to achieve its goals. Despite the violent onslaught of 1947-49, Israel emerged as a sovereign state. But the Arabs of the land, sustained by broader Arab support, refused to accept this outcome. They proceeded to undo it through a variety of means, including repeated wars, economic boycotts, international condemnations and a complete refusal of the refugees themselves to be settled, as it would effectively mean accepting that the war was over. \n\nhttps://t.co/NY8E4ecoBH that end of keeping the war of 1948 alive until its goal of undoing the Jewish state could be achieved, a temporary agency established to resettle the refugees - UNRWA (initially called REWA, but the Arabs insisted on the letters UN so that it would appear to enjoy international legitimacy) - was hijacked by the Arab refugees. As a result of this hijacking UNRWA effectively became a Palestinian entity devoted singularly to sustaining and stoking the idea that uniquely among the world’s refugees, Palestinians don’t need to move on and can keep insisting on “return”, both in space and in time, to a time when there was no Israel. UNRWA thus became the mechanism by which the Jewish people alone were denied the right to to consider their hard won self-determination and sovereign statehood as a done deal. \n\n(Part 2 continues in the first comment:)"

        "text": "Thought more about this. In this nonsensical rant diminishing Western values and removing all agency from Palestinians, Shadi (completely by accident) actually got to the heart of the problem:\n\nThe problem is that Palestinians have been convinced that despite continuing violence started by them leading them nowhere, they don’t have any responsibility to compromise and accept reality. That because they are oppressed (in the view of people like Shadi), they are entitled to total victory regardless of reality. \n\nThis is what has led Palestinians to be unable to accept the reality of an Israeli state existing in that area. It is what has led Palestinian leaders to exploit the system to steal from Palestinians without taking any accountability for their circumstances.\n\nThe Palestinians feel entitled to all of the land and they keep being told if they just persist, that’s what they will get. It’s why random people in the U.S. who have never lived anywhere near Israel still talk about how the land was stolen from them whereas every other set of refugees in history, especially those that resulted from losing a war, have moved on and adapted to the reality of their present circumstances. That’s why the 900,000 Jews that were ethnically cleansed from Arab countries AFTER 1948 don’t spend their time focusing on how they get their payback/compensation, but the Palestinian Arabs are still trapped in refugee camps more focused on how they destroy Israel than how they create a prosperous society for their current generation. That’s why a majority of Palestinians supported terrorism against Jews and Israelis prior to 10/7 or the response. It’s why they support Hamas despite Hamas not caring one bit about the actual state of the Palestinian people.\n\nSo we will be stuck in this cycle until a Sadat-like leader comes along and tells the Palestinian people that they must accept the reality of Israel’s existence and then try to build a future within that reality. But there is no incentive for such a leader to come about when instead they can become billionaires by stealing never-ending aid and blame Israel for the continued poor circumstances of their own people knowing WaPo editors will prop up that delusion and blame Israel at the cost of continuing cycles of violence and poverty for the Palestinian people."

Who is Oron Shaul you ask?\nOron Shaul was an Israeli soldier, who was brutally abducted and killed by Hamas terrorists during the 2014 Gaza conflict. Oron Shaul's capture and the subsequent refusal by Hamas to return his remains for a proper burial have been a source of deep anguish and fury for his family and the Israeli people. Despite numerous calls for his repatriation and international pressure, Hamas has callously denied Oron Shaul the dignity of a proper burial, leaving his loved ones and many others with an enduring sense of anger and injustice. This is what that square praises in Gaza. Horrific."

          "text": "Why are there even places called “refugee camps” in Gaza? And why are two thirds of the people living in Gaza, who were born there and lived there their entire lives, called “refugees” from a war that ended more than seven decades ago? The answers to these question unlock the core of the conflict. Here they are (Part 1; Part 2 in the first comment):\n\n1.The 20th century has been marked by a transition from empires to states. We begin the 20th century when much of the world is divided between empires. We end it when much of the world is divided between states. When lucky, those states were based on the self determination of a people who share a common history, language, ethnicity, background religion and connection to a territory. (Zionism emerged in this context based on the idea of self determination for the Jewish people in the only territory to which they were ever connected as a people). When unlucky those new states were artificially created by receding empires drawing boundaries, forcing different peoples to share one state, leading almost always to civil war, dictatorship, or both. This transition has been bloody. It involved two world wars and numerous regional and civil wars. In the bloody process of empires receding and new states emerging to replace them, tens of millions of people were displaced, fleeing across newly created borders, typically to new countries with an ethnic makeup similar to their own. This was true of Hindus and Muslim, Ukrainians, Poles and Germans, Bulgarians, Greeks and Turks and Arabs and Jews. This was not unique.\n\n2.What was unique is that one group only of refugees from that time and those wars were allowed to maintain themselves as endless refugees in anticipation of one day winning a war they had lost. Those were the Arab refugees from the war of 1948, later to be known as Palestinians. All other refugee groups, except the Palestinians, were presented with a clear message: “it’s tough, it’s tragic, move on”. There was a clear understanding that in the most fundamental sense there is no going back - not in place and not in time (thus, there was no such thing as “a right of return”). To seek to go back would mean endless war. And so the message was forward looking and future facing. Tens of millions of refugees and displaced persons, among them millions of Jews, would build new lives in the new countries to which they fled.\n\n3.Except Palestinians. The war that the Arabs of the land and the surrounding countries waged to prevent a Jewish state from emerging and gaining independence failed to achieve its goals. Despite the violent onslaught of 1947-49, Israel emerged as a sovereign state. But the Arabs of the land, sustained by broader Arab support, refused to accept this outcome. They proceeded to undo it through a variety of means, including repeated wars, economic boycotts, international condemnations and a complete refusal of the refugees themselves to be settled, as it would effectively mean accepting that the war was over. \n\nhttps://t.co/NY8E4ecoBH that end of keeping the war of 1948 alive until its goal of undoing the Jewish state could be achieved, a temporary agency established to resettle the refugees - UNRWA (initially called REWA, but the Arabs insisted on the letters UN so that it would appear to enjoy international legitimacy) - was hijacked by the Arab refugees. As a result of this hijacking UNRWA effectively became a Palestinian entity devoted singularly to sustaining and stoking the idea that uniquely among the world’s refugees, Palestinians don’t need to move on and can keep insisting on “return”, both in space and in time, to a time when there was no Israel. UNRWA thus became the mechanism by which the Jewish people alone were denied the right to to consider their hard won self-determination and sovereign statehood as a done deal. \n\n(Part 2 continues in the first comment:)"
