When people claim this started with Israeli actions in 1947 and 1948 they are either lying or spouting ignorance. The plan was to exterminate the Jews before 1947.\n\nThis is directly from the archives of the German Foreign Ministry:\n\n\"The Führer then made the following statement to the Mufti, enjoining him to lock it in the uttermost depths of his heart:\n\n1. He (the Führer) would carry on the battle to the total destruction of the Judeo-Communist empire in Europe.\n\n2. At some moment which was impossible to set exactly today, but which in any event was not distant, the German armies would in the course of this struggle reach the southern exit from Caucasia.\n\n3. As soon as this had happened, the Führer would on his own give the Arab world the assurance that its hour of liberation had arrived. Germany's objective would then be solely the destruction of the Jewish element residing in the Arab sphere under the protection of British power. In that hour the Mufti would be the most authoritative spokesman for the Arab world. It would then be his task to set off the Arab operations which he had secretly, prepared. When that time had come, Germany could also be indifferent to French reaction to such a declaration.\"\n\nDocuments on German Foreign Policy, 1918-1945, Series D (1937-1945), Volume XIII: The War Years, March 23-September 30, 1941, doc. 515"

And then some are upset that I use harsh criticism against these online advocates & activists. Well, I call them Twitter warriors because those supposed \"sympathizers\" are incredibly patronizing & condescending when they talk over Palestinian voices, refuse to accept various perspectives & cheer on a supposed resistance group (Hamas) that has caused immense damage to the Palestinian national project & brought needless wars & death upon its people. We need allies who empower Palestinian voices & uplift them, not malign dissenting perspectives by calling them \"bootlickers, traitors, or Zionist sellouts.\" Not all sympathy is helpful; to the contrary, it can be detrimental.\n\nImagine telling Afghans who are opposed to the Taliban that they're sellouts because the group fought America's occupation. Imagine telling Iraqis who were against al-Qaeda's brutality against civilians that they're bootlickers of U.S. occupation because AQ \"resisted\" the Americans. Just because someone uses \"liberation\" or \"resistance\" labels or slogans doesn't mean they're effective, moral, or worthy of support. The Viet Cong were a resistance group against U.S. occupation. Still, they were incredibly ruthless & killed hundreds of thousands of their people as a matter of policy, all in the pursuit of liberation - does that mean they were moral or worthy of support? Did the South Vietnamese people deserve to be called sellouts & bootlicker traitors simply because they wanted a different country from what the communists were working towards? Well, I can promise you that the majority of Palestinians in Gaza don't want to live in an Islamist utopia that the likes of Hamas ultimately want to create. \n\nI'll keep repeating this over and over: tens of thousands of Gazans would still be alive or uninjured if Hamas kept its fighters and members at home on Oct. 7th - and while Gaza would still be under a blockade, there could have been political choices & decisions made to change that reality. \n\nAnd yes, of course, I support Palestinian self-determination and the right to life, liberty, and effective resistance against the Israeli occupation & violence. Remember, there's a difference between what's right VS. what's effective VS. what's moral VS. what's emotional VS. what's suicidal."

        "text": "Such nonsense. The Houthis hate Jews because genocidal political antisemitism is historically endemic to Yemen. The 2000-year-old Jewish community, which had been largely expelled in the post-48 period, saw its finally members ethnically cleansed by the Houthis - who had to flee to *Israel!* \n\n--------------- \n\nYemen was a cradle of Jewish civilization, their scholars and rabbis considered among the most dutiful preservers of the Hebrew language. But Yemen was also a land of normalized cultural antisemitism, where Jews had second-class status and were frequently subjected to lethal - and even exterminative - violence. Of the many crimes perpetrated on the Jews of Yemen, the Mawza Exile is among the worst: in the late 17th century, the Jews were banished from the cities and towns in Yemen by decree of King Mahdi Ahmad, and sent into a wasteland region of Yemen with no capacity to sustain themselves. A deathmarch and a year of starvation in Mawza would take the lives of a substantial part of the Jewish community before they would be allowed to return to the cities. The reason for the reprieve? The Jews were the predominant urban craftsmen in a largely rural, agrarian country - apparently, the King was being inundated by complaints about a lack of effective farm implements, among other things. The antisemitic decree of the year before had brought ruin to Yemeni economy. So, in order to take up their traditional, key role in the Yemeni social-economy, the Jews were rehabilitated from their exile. \n\nBy any measure, the Mawza exile would be considered both an act of ethnic cleansing *and* genocide: the former, insofar as the Jews were forcibly removed from their homes and communities; and the latter insofar as - with the inhospitable conditions of the Mawza area, and their capacity to fend for themselves  severely curtailed through seizure and rapid expulsion - the only logical expectation, and therefore purpose, of such an act was to cause mass death and suffering among the Jews. I've read that anywhere from a quarter to half the Jewish population died, on the march and in exile, from disease, starvation, and exposure. In many ways, the Jewish experience at Mawza bears a similarity to events like the Holdomor and the Irish potato famine - but what it most resembles, to me, is the Madagascar Plan. This was a Nazi idea to expel the Jews to Madagascar with no capacity to feed or sustain themselves, leading to mass death and, ultimately, the destruction of the Jewish people. This plan was explored by the Nazi's but was deemed unfeasible - instead, they settled on the Final Solution in Europe. \n\nIndeed, although in many ways especially brutal, the experience of Jews in Yemen were not exceptional in the history of the diaspora - but that's the point. Antisemitism isn't a product of Zionism, it predates the Jewish national movement by millennia. Zionism is a response to the conditions imposed on Jewish communal life in the diaspora, a solution to the precarity and indignity Jews have been intentionally subjected to by their non-Jewish overlords. The antisemitic king in Yemen who expelled the Jews into the Mawza expanse was a member of a Zaidi dynasty - the same sect of Shia Islam that the Houthis, as a religious fundamentalist group, are committed to expanding and entrenching as a force in Yemen and abroad. Zaidi Islam by no means need be antisemitic, but antisemitism is a historic fixture of Zaidi political expression in Yemen, and has been since at least the time of the Mawza exile. \n\nZionism did not inspire or create the antisemitism of the Houthis, the reverse is true: the antisemitism of the Houthis made Zionism necessary - and their continued antagonism to Israel only further exacerbates extremist tendencies in the Zionist movement and Israeli society, rather than countering it as many of their newfound Western supporters may believe... \n\ncont'd, 1/"

She nonetheless boasted, “I am a rape crisis counselor, I believe the survivors.” She went on to say that it’s racist to say that Palestinians committed rape.\n\nIn a Facebook post in Sep. 2020, Sima cited support of Leila Khaled, a leading member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine who participated in the hijacking of planes in 1969 and 1970. (Khaled has said that the Second Intifada, during which over 1,000 Israelis were murdered by Palestinians had failed because it was not violent enough.) Just recently, Sima has attended at least one on-campus Palestinian rally, where she was seen chanting, “Globalize the Intifada.”\n\nSima is now up for promotion at the University of Minnesota for the school’s top DEI job. \n\nhttps://t.co/HOzBjTBSRK\n\nUniversity of Minnesota is funded by taxpayers.
