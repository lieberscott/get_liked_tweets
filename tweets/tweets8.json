The twins who were always together and their world was shattered on October 7th when Hamas terrorists infiltrated israel, the twins who tried to help others, an arrow pierced their hearts with every gunshot, they knew - these are their people who fall one after the other. First Osher's body was identified, after a few days Michael's body was also found. \"Mom, I know you were hoping at least one of us would come back, but I couldn't leave my twin brother behind\" A friend wrote in their memory. This is a story about Michael and Osher, the beautiful, kind and pleasant people who were born together and murdered together.  It's a story about two brothers who never did anything wrong - and were buried side by side in Jerusalem. It's a story about one woman who stood over their grave and asked: \"Now who will call me mother?\""

Eden who came to work as a bartender at the Nova Nature Festival, she danced and was happy. When the terrorists infiltrated the party area, she began her survival journey, while all this time her sister tried to help her with concern. During the conversation, Eden screamed from the panic she felt from the terrorists' shots. Eden told her sister that she went to hide in the car where her two friends who were murdered were lying. Eden described to her that she could hear the blood dripping from the murdered women in the car and she had to run away from the car because the phones of the murdered women started ringing. She hid under a bush which she said did not hide her enough. The conversation between Eden and Shani ended when Aden told her: \"they caught me\" and shouting in Arabic in the background. Searches carried out at the last location she sent made it clear: Eden was kidnapped to Gaza. This is a story about Eden who didn't go to battle, she just came to work, in a bar where almost all of its employees were murdered, in a bar that became a mass grave on Saturday morning. It is a story about the gentle Eden that is held captive by monsters. Monsters that raped and devoured every life they met. I wish Eden will return to Israel healthy. I wish."

This traditional square-shaped cotton scarf dates back to ancient Mesopotamia around 3100 BC, ùê∞ùê®ùê´ùêß ùêõùê≤ ùêÅùêöùêõùê≤ùê•ùê®ùêßùê¢ùêöùêßùê¨ ùêöùêßùêù ùêíùêÆùê¶ùêûùê´ùê¢ùêöùêßùê¨, ùêßùê®ùê≠ ùêèùêöùê•ùêûùê¨ùê≠ùê¢ùêßùê¢ùêöùêßùê¨. The term 'keffiyeh' originates from the ùêäùêÆùêüùêö ùêöùê´ùêûùêö ùê®ùêü ùêàùê´ùêöùê™, signifying \"from the city of Kufa,\" with ùêßùê® ùê≠ùê¢ùêûùê¨ ùê≠ùê® ùêÜùêöùê≥ùêö ùê®ùê´ ùê≠ùê°ùêû ùêñùêûùê¨ùê≠ ùêÅùêöùêßùê§.\n\nHistorically, the keffiyeh was vital for Bedouins- people in desert regions, serving as protection against harsh weather conditions like heat and sandstorms. \n\nLater in history, particularly during British rule, this scarf became more widely available in the land of Israel and its markets. Some Palestinian terrorists began using it as a full mask to cover their faces during criminal operations, diverging from its traditional use. Subsequently, Yasser Arafat started wearing it, adopting a style that was not traditionally his own, thereby claiming it as another form of occupying or appropriating a dress code.\n\nContrary to popular belief, during the Ottoman era, Palestinian men primarily wore the tarbosh, another non-Palestinian headgear, influenced by Turkish culture.\n\nHere's a visual representation of how the Iraqi people, the true inheritors of the kufiya, traditionally wear it.\n\n#Gaza #Israel #HamasTerrorrists #Palestine"
