Before being dragged by two terrorists, she managed to see how they shot her husband point blank. He blew her a kiss before he died.\nHer abductor snatched her jewellery, a young man on the street took her glasses. She couldn’t see her whole time there. \nShe was taken to a tunnel along other hostages. She recalls how they decided to pass the time by each giving a lecture on his own field of expertise. Alex Dancyg, a renowned historian, spoke about the holocaust, the group asked him to stop as they felt identification.\nAdina decided to negotiate with the guards. When 5-year-old Emilia Aloni couldn’t stop crying of fear from their weapons, Adina approached the head guard and explained that this group of old hostages wouldn’t pose a risk and asked him to lower the weapons down as the child is frightened. He agreed. \nA few time during her weeks there, head of Hamas in Gaza, Sinwar, was there. He entered their room and - in Hebrew- asked how they were. The group didn’t answer. \nWhen she was told she is being released, Adina argued with the guards and to let other hostages, in worse condition to go home. They declined.\nShe recalls the harrowing moments of release, when hundreds of Gazans threw rocks at the Red Cross car which took them to Egypt. \nI won’t ever get out of it. She told @N12News .",

Her efforts included helicopter support and reservists coming in by rushed cellphone calls landing in the fields of the farming community.\n\nThey assembled a full combat field command post to enter the fighting, including by air and rescue Israelis under siege by Hamas, it was active FOR 2 WEEKS at the start of the war. 👀 \n\nCaptain Yuval, 24.\nHave you ever heard so such a people as the nation of Israel?  🇮🇱"

Another 5 \"journalists\" were killed while being close to other terrorists who were eliminated.\n\nFor example, the \"journalist\" Maztapa Taria who was killed alongside the \"journalist\" Hamza al-Dahdo, who according to documents found by the IDF in Gaza, both belonged to the terrorist organizations in Gaza. \n\nor the journalists Muhammad Mater, Anas Abu Shamla and Montaser al-Sawaf - all belong to the terrorist organization Hamas. All these are just examples of \"journalists\" killed in Gaza.\n\nOnly 19% of the killed journalists were not proven to be terrorists, and the circumstances of their deaths were not precisely determined. In any war, circumstances may become clear in the future, and sometimes journalists die in tragic circumstances\n\nWhile in  Israel has press freedom and liberal democracy, allowing any journalist visiting Israel to speak freely, And every journalist who has been in Israel will testify to that. in Gaza, controlled by the fundamentalist Islamic terror organization Hamas, has no press freedom at all.\n\nEvery war is terrible, and the current conflict in Gaza is especially dire. As part of their military strategy, Hamas uses civilians as human shields, both in combat and as shields for their terror infrastructure and rocket launchers.\n\nAs a result, despite the IDF's immense efforts, civilians continuously suffer. Reports from Gaza on casualty numbers, IDF airstrikes, and fighting between IDF soldiers and Hamas are constantly quoted by international media, but verifying these claims is challenging, and many have been proven entirely false.\n\nIn Gaza, there are no journalists who can expose the truth about these numbers and reports. True journalists working in Gaza cannot reveal that, for example, in an airstrike, civilians were not killed, only Hamas militants were.\n\nIf a Gaza journalist dares to tell the truth about the number of terrorists killed, Hamas will kill them immediately them.\nNone of the real journalists in Gaza can tell the truth.\n\nThe truth is one of the casualties of war, so it's crucial to expose the journey of lies and manipulation by the terror organization Hamas.\n\nVery few journalists in Gaza are genuine journalists, and even they can't tell the truth due to the dictatorial and terrorist rule in Gaza. The rest of the \"journalists\" in Gaza are not journalists but terrorists collaborating with Hamas.\n\nIt's time to understand that most journalists in Gaza are #TerroristsNotJournalists. And those who are real  journalists do not tell the truth.\n\nA \"press\" vest, anyone can buy at \"Ali Express\", but not everyone who wears a press vest is a journalist.\n#HamasislSIS #TerroristsNotJournalists",

Israeli army is right now about 6-7 kilometers away from the Al Mawasi humanitarian safe zone (see the recent map from January 21 below), the ground forces of IDF are not in Al Mawasi or anywhere near. There is no existing sniper rifle that can cover that long range (mostly they are good for along shot between 1000-1500 meters, rarely slightly farther)\n2. We can hear automatic gun fire in the video, not a single shot fire that sniper rifle produces, which implies we hear a machine gun fire (like M-16 or Kalashnikov) and effective range for those are between 500 to 550 meters for M-16 and 350 meters for Kalashnikov.\n3. The clip is edited between the time we hear gunshots and we see the body - it misses several seconds of the footage and these are important seconds, because during these seconds the person was hit with a bullet\n4. We do not see on the video any armed person, we do not have a clear visual on the body either, the angle does not allow us to see where he was hit and from which direction, what we see is that he is covered with a white piece of cloth and dragged to a nearby area behind the fence\n\nOverall: we do not have enough data to reach any conclusion on who shot him right now"

They were happy people, it is said that they were like a ray of sunshine that shone on everyone around them. Each of them ended up in a relationship with a child and they became one warm and happy family. They went to the Nova music festival with some friends, they left the children with Antonio's parents. When the shooting started, she called her brother and told him in a frightened and terrified voice: \"They are shooting at us!, they are shooting at us! They are blowing us up\". The family then tried to call them several times but she did not answer anymore. In the shelter, grenades were thrown at them, they were seriously injured when a terrorist entered and shot all the wounded repeatedly. A survivor from the shelter said that Antonio was slowly dying for several hours. They had no chance. The two small children were waiting for them at home, Antonio's 7-year-old daughter Manuela and Yvonne's 4 and a half-year-old son Aviel. For many days they did not know what had become of them until the news arrived. The social workers and psychologists told the children that mom and dad had died. It's a sad story, about Yvonne and Antonio who loved to dance salsa, loved to be happy and entertain. But most of all they loved little Manuela and Aviel. It's a story about a family that Hamas monsters murdered in an instant, it's a story about small children crying. This is a story about Antonio and Yvonne - in life and in death they were inseparable."

She really loved her garden in the small apartment where she lived in Ofakim and every day until the last day she would go out to the garden and tend it. This is a story about yelizbeta who always took care of those around her, was very caring and loving. On October 7 at 06:40 she sent her daughter a message: \"Rita, there are a lot of alarms and booms and there is nothing on the news. It is dangerous for the neighbors who have to take small children out so early in the morning and stand in a stairwell during the alarms\". yelizbeta did on that terrible morning what she had done all her life - cared for others. She decided to go open the door and call the neighbors to come and hide from the missiles in the protected room of her house. But when yelizbeta opened the door, a ruthless Hamas monster murdered her with unimaginable brutality and left her bleeding to death in the doorway of her house. yelizbeta had no chance, she never reached the neighbors. This is a story about the 78-year-old yelizbeta, who was a complete world. She loved her family, had a big heart, was wise, modest and had a charming smile. This is a story about yelizbeta, who never hurt anyone, yelizbeta that in the terrifying moments of the morning of October 7th thought of others and most of all, she wanted to live."

They of course do not differentiate between combatants and civilians. \n\nIf we are, for argument’s sake, going to accept Hamas numbers then we should also accept IDF numbers that the military has killed around 9,000 combatants (if you accept a terrorist’s numbers please have the decency to accept the democracy’s claims too). \n\nWith those numbers, the combatant-civilian death ratio in Gaza is about 1:1.5 and less than 1:2. In other words, for every combatant killed, around 1.5 civilians are killed. \n\nEvery loss of civilian life is tragic, but with this ratio, not only should Israel not be accused of genocide (that’s obvious), world leaders should be applauding the IDF’s precision-strike capabilities. As a point of reference, according to the UN, civilians usually make up around 90 percent of casualties in war. That’s a 1:9 ratio (one combatant for every nine civilians). \n\nWhat is happening in Gaza is unique - it is a new form of warfare (urban setting, extensive use of human shields and massive tunnel infrastructure) and still the ratio is low. \n\nWhat the IDF is doing will be studied by other militaries for decades to come. No other military in the world has ever achieved this."

You were chasing the story, and Farah, to this day, regrets she got the story wrong. I regret it too. Those are the mistakes that happen. \n\nYou were trying to talk to Gilani directly. In this hour, your wife Mariane knew something was wrong. You didn’t answer your phone.\n\nYou always answered your phone. They took your phone. They chained you to a car engine. The guards later told the police you were confused. \n\nThey took your clothes. They brought you a 1970s warmup jacket and made you change into it. You were confused. \n\nOh poor dear Danny. We are in that compound with you, although the years have passed and you are not there anymore. We are with you, dear friend. Now and always. \n\nThis is the photo they sent of you. I want to ask the world: can you see Danny’s middle finger at his terrorists? That is the message that I received. \n\nFight the jerks, the militants, the extremists, the terrorists. \n\nShow them the middle finger. Defeat them with will power, intellect and heart.\n\nYou, Danny, could not do so in body, but I know you are with us, Danny, in spirit, so we can prevail to know the world you were always trying to both realize and celebrate.  \n\nTake Danny’s symbolic gesture with you, friends, real or imagined, to give yourself courage and determination. It has fueled me for the 21 years since, and we will use our courage to defeat the ideology and hate that seized this innocent man from the streets. For Danny.\n\nxoxo"
