Even though there already existed The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) this separate agency was created by the UN General Assembly.\n\nUNRWA has not solved, but rather exacerbated the refugee situation. Instead of resettling refugees, like the UNHCR, it perpetuates their claims and inflames their irredentist ideology. It’s schools, hospitals and various programs employ radical Islamist ideologues, propagandists and foot soldiers. It’s benefits fund terrorism and are a pillar of the festering sore that is the “right of return” to all of Israel and the restoration of a mythical Palestine that never existed.\n\nAlthough UNRWA claims to aid over 5 million refugees, these people (and registered deceased and non-existent people) are not refugees by any definition. Refugee status is not maintained when people are resettled, let alone to offspring of those displaced.\n\nUNRWA was wrong in conception and disastrous in execution. It’s 1.5 billion annual budget (funded by the US, other countries, and NGOs) is sponsoring terrorism, totalitarianism, anti-Western hate and virulent antisemitism. Their facilities, personnel and budget are co-opted by criminals. The sometimes ignore, and often aid and participate in terrorism and crime. It’s time to end the farce that is UNRWA. It is long past time to #DefundUNRWA. https://t.co/ggn3oREPcI",

Within a few years after 1967, when Moscow first made antizionism its domestic & foreign policy priority, some 250k Soviet Jews emigrated, mostly to Israel. 25 years later 1.5 million were gone. (The only reason it took that long is that the USSR shut down Jewish emigration for nearly a decade in the middle.)\n\nThe Soviet case also shows how effortlessly left-wing antizionism merges with extremist far-right, neo-Nazi type Jew-hatred. During perestroika, as the state began to fall apart, all kinds of neo-fascist groups started to emerge, which until then had been suppressed. Among their leaders were the ideologues of late-Soviet antizionism—people who gave us the pearls about Zionism being racism, settler-colonialism, imperialism, etc. They preached the tropes of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion & the antizionism of the left in the same breath. \n\nTheir audiences were ordinary Soviet citizens yearning to understand why their world was falling apart. Nobody among them knew or cared that antizionism & antisemitism are not supposed to be the same. Theoretical distinctions between Jews and Zionists didn’t matter to them one bit. They were just glad to learn that there was, in fact, a big & dangerous enemy out there that controlled & undermined everything. Everything finally made sense.\n\nSoviet Jews like myself who lived through that time remember the very real fears of antisemitic violence & pogroms permeating it. Those were a critical factor in our decision to emigrate. \n\nWe are seeing a similar phenomenon right now in the US & elsewhere in the West. The far-right is happy to jump on the progressive-Islamist antizionist bandwagon. The ideologues of these movements know that distinctions between different forms of Jew-hatred matter only in theory. The bigger the crisis, the quicker the distinctions disappear in practice, and the quicker all the fingers begin to point to Jews, whether they are Zionist, non-Zionist, anti-Zionist or post-Zionist. The only thing that matters in real life is that Jews are to blame. Which is precisely Einat’s point."

Afterward, by the very next day, Hassan Nasrallah announced that Israel had no other way of getting these soldiers back except through negotiations. Israel reacted the same way as they're doing today, saying they don't care; they have the right to defend themselves and that they'll destroy Hezbollah. They went in, faced fierce fighting by Hezbollah fighters, lost more than a hundred people, and were forced to retreat. They could not achieve any of their military objectives, neither to destroy Hezbollah nor to rescue the hostages. That's how you were humiliated when you were forced to release the Lebanese hostages. Stop lying."
