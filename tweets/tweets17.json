Victims have been killed with a single shot in the forehead or neck, or several times by Kalashnikov machine gun fire. They were raped, burnt and indescribably mutilated.\nThe returned hostages were examined by physicians and psychiatrists. MRIs, CRPs and drug residue testing showed sub-levels in blood cells, electrolytes and metabolites, and in some broken bones, burn marks, and fresh scars. The most striking discovery were ketamine residues. No wonder they 'looked happy, waved and smiled' for Hamas cameras when they were released to the IRC. The only hostages who were treated 'fairly well', though locked up in isolation with very little food, were those held by Hamas terrorists and UNRWA staff (!!) in their private homes. All by all, it was not ClubMed Gaza as those Hamas lovers claim on social media.\nIt has taken Israel 70 days to find and examine bodies and residues in burnt out houses. More bodies have been found in the fields around the music festival. And there are still missing.\nMiraculously, Hamas claims that as of right now exactly 16,847 Gazan civilians, of which 9,199 children and 51 journalists, have been killed by targeted(?) Israeli carpet bombing. None were killed by the 40% misfired Hamas and PIJ missiles, like in 2014. These 'exact' numbers were determined with hardly any medical staff, of which most were allegedly killed by Israeli snipers. And, of course, not one single 'brave Hamas freedom fighter' has been killed. Crazy, but certain people believe all and anything Hamas claims."

They were there when the Phoenicians were there, when the Babylonians were there, and when the Romans were there.

The father spoke Hebrew as he used to work in Israel.\nThe family’s mother and daughters were guarding Doron and her girls 24/7.\nDoron had a surgery for her injury, it was done on the sofa, without anaesthetic, with her daughters by her side.\nThey were there for 16 days, and then moved to a hospital where they were kept for the reminder 33 days with a group of 7 other hostages in a small room.\nThere was barely any food, and the food they did get they mainly gave the young kids. They also saved some as they didn’t know whether they’ll get fed the following day. Some days food didn’t arrive until evening.\nEvery night, Doron was afraid her girls will be taken away. She barely slept.  \nThe terrorists guards kept demanding silence. They explained that their concerns are from a lynching mob.\nThe girls are still talking about their experience everyday. They witnessed horrific scenes and family members murdered during 7.10. Doron says that, while captive, she developed a kind of a mental defence barrier to protect the girls, and that she thinks that she isn’t fully capable to comprehend what they have been through even now."

Therefore they must be the oppressor because Palestinians are stateless and have much less power, right?\n\nWRONG.\n\nIsrael is a state because they worked towards building one, accepting one, because they were desperate for it after 2000 years of exile and persecution. They have a powerful army because they have faced more existential threats than any other people or country on earth.\n\nThe Palestinians do not have one because they have rejected it over and over again, because they are antisemitic and they refuse to live alongside Jews with any sort of relative power in an Arab Islamic supremacist part of the world.\n\nIt is important to be aware of the fact that Hamas leaders are BILLIONAIRES while their people live in squalor. This is a clear signal of something very wrong! People who admonish Israel on the basis of power conveniently leave this out. They *have* power, it’s just in the hands of a few Palestinian dictators."

No other solution could be more beneficial for them.\n\nYet, none of these self-proclaimed justice fighters that I've mentioned are speaking out for this cause.\n\nWhat they're actually calling for is a \"ceasefire.\"\n\nBut whose ceasefire, exactly? Israel's?\n\nThey're well aware, like everyone else, that the moment Israel lays down its weapons, it will be attacked, as has repeatedly happened throughout its history. \nAnd just as bad, if not worse, Hamas will maintain control, which may be the greatest tragedy for the people of Gaza.\n\nTherefore, there's no rational reason for a generic, supposedly moral call for a ceasefire instead of directly and explicitly demanding Hamas to surrender and free all hostages.\n\nYet, this remains their chosen approach.\n\nIt seems they want us to think they care, but in truth, their concerns are elsewhere.\n\nFor some, it's about maintaining relevance now that their glory days are behind them. For others, it's probably deeper issues, a particularly strong sense of injustice when Jews are involved, less so when it involves Asians, Africans, or Europeans."

They have a powerful army because they have faced more existential threats than any other people or country on earth.\n\nThe Palestinians do not have one because they have rejected it over and over again, because they are antisemitic and they refuse to live alongside Jews with any sort of relative power in an Arab Islamic supremacist part of the world.\n\nIt is important to be aware of the fact that Hamas leaders are BILLIONAIRES while their people live in squalor.
