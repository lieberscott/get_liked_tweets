Savages. Very very bad people. Irredeemable excrement. ‚Ä¶ May they all rot in hell.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShiran sent inquiries to multiple members of the faculty and administration seeking assurances that she was safe on campus,‚Äù per the law firm. ‚ÄúShe received no response to her initial email or the two follow-ups she sent, and has still received no response‚Äînearly two months later.‚Äù\n\nThe student also alleges that a professor at the school allowed a Muslim student to stop collaborating with her on an assignment ‚Äúsolely because Shiran ‚Äòdenies the genocide so clearly taking place.'‚Äù\n\nThe assignment with the children‚Äôs drawings allegedly stated: ‚ÄúSometimes we can also work with clients‚Äô experiences/backgrounds that are ‚Äòtoo close to home‚Äô and we need to deal with our own complicated feelings, internalized racism/ ableism/ homophobia/ supremacy and countertransference, etc. Can you keep it professional and still empathize with clients even when the content of their art upsets or triggers you?‚Äù"

During the early days of the war, Duwairi insisted that #Israel was pounding Gaza Strip from the air because it was too chicken to invade. When the invasion started, Duwairi said the IDF incursion was in open areas only and that the Israelis were suffering very heavy losses repelling their advance. After Israel completely took over north Gaza, including Gaza City, Duwairi said now comes the hard part because Khanyounes is Sinwar's hometown and Hamas's fortified headquarters. Now that Israel is making advances and is set to sweep all of Khanyounes, Duwairi said this minutes ago: Israel needs at least a month to take Khanyounes and destroy Hamas. There is no way the world, especially America, will give Netanyahu this much time, and therefore Israel won't be able to destroy Hamas, like it promised, and Hamas will prevail, win the war and Israel will emerge as a defeated failure.\nDelusions have been at the heart of 76 years of Palestinian misery.",

Academic/intellectual terrorists like Ghada Sasa (@sasa_ghada) remind us why the pro-Palestine movement is going down the toilet and is destined to fail unless a new wave of intellectual diversity is injected into it. This violent person doesn't seem to have benefited much from having a PhD & going through rigorous academic training. Yesterday, she launched horrendous personal attacks against me for expressing a different view about the future & what Zionism is/its relation to the conflict. She had hundreds of her equally violent sycophants bombard me with hate, threats, and harassment. Instead of engaging in a Twitter fight, I politely messaged her and tried to rise above her venom, hatred & violence to suggest that she let me tell her who I am and what I think. I also shared with her the Gaza food air drops proposal article that I wrote/published & urged her to keep the focus on the humanitarian needs of Gazans and to put aside our differences, telling her that attacking someone who lost half of his family in Gaza is just a mean, bad thing. \n\nIn her post, she literally made fun of my appearance and turned my profile photo, which shows a $50 whale-watching trip in the San Francisco Bay, into me being a \"yacht\" owner sellout traitor who's making money off the Zionist rich Jews. Underneath her original post, there are dozens of cartoonish-level insults of people making fun of my teeth, my eyes, and my shaved head. Like clockwork, dozens of self-described communists immediately shared their posts that I'm a U.S. \"intelligence asset\" based on childish notions inferred from my graduate education & training in national security. These are the people who allege to care about the injustices that Palestinians experience. Ghada didn't offer a single word of condolence for the 35 family members killed by an IDF airstrike. Instead, she posted another immature & entitled tantrum today, initiating a new wave of violent, hateful \"activists and pro-Palestine supporters\" who are attacking me & flooding my inbox & posts with harassment. This is all while I've been focusing on getting food to hungry Gazans via airdrops and trying to actually do something useful for Palestinians in Gaza. \n\nI share this not because I'm particularly distraught, fearful, or worried about hateful Twitter Mujahideen who could care less about offering anything meaningful to promote the Palestinian cause. Rather, I'm trying to demonstrate just how terribly difficult it is for so many Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims to express different beliefs that challenge entrenched and dominant beliefs. When you wonder why so many don't speak out against Hamas, promote new action & a different future, or critique the failures of the Palestinian national project, think about people like Ghada & thousands like her. For 75 years, the Palestinian cause has been dominated by a few narratives that force conformity & demonize/criminalize any deviations or dissent. This is not only true in the Palestinian Territories & the Arab world but especially so in the diaspora communities, particularly in the West. So many Palestinians/Arabs/Muslims, privately & in 1 on 1 conversations, will tell you just how fed up they are with the conflict & that they wish we could coexist with Israelis and, yes, Zionists. But so many aren't willing to pay the heavy price of being attacked, threatened, and ostracized from their families & communities. I have the tremendous privilege of speaking freely & not caring about blowback or repercussions. But so many people don't want to or can't afford to pay the costly price to be & think differently. \n\nI'll leave you with this, and I've never shared this publicly before. In 2017, I attempted to go to Israel to visit some friends and connect with backers of my Gaza airport proposal to get an IDF-approved airfield in Gaza to allow for freedom of movement. Because I said the word Israel in a Facebook post expressing my excitement to meet with friends & supporters of the humanitarian airport project, hundreds of pro-Palestine Facebook accounts attacked me viciously & hundreds more \"unfriended me,\" launching horrendous campaigns to malign me and accuse me of being a sellout traitor, agent, spy, etc. They wanted me to say Palestine or \"Historic Palestine\" because Israel \"doesn't exist\" according to them. One of the byproducts of this massive campaign of hate was that Hamas authorities in Gaza took notice & went and harassed family members of mine, asking them if I were truly interested in the wellbeing of Gazans or if I was an Israeli spy. I will never forget or forgive how these \"pro-Palestine\" Western activists literally got my family in harm's way & caused a terrorist organization to harass my folks simply because I used the word Israel instead of saying Palestine. \n\nTwitter Mujahideen & \"resistance porn\" promoters are an enemy of the pro-Palestine movement."
