        "text": "“First We Cut the Throats of the Jews, Then the Gays and Finally the Christians”\n\n(An article fromTichys Einblick)\n\nGermany: Educators and social workers are discovering to their dismay that it is all but impossible to “integrate” young Muslim immigrants into German society.\n\nArk spokesman warns against radical young people\n\nTeachers and social workers are sounding the alarm: Arab young people are becoming more and more radical. Islamism has long since won in some migrant milieus.\n\n“Germany will soon be ours.” The sentence scares Wolfgang Büscher, and the man is hardly afraid of anything else.\n\nThe spokesman for the children’s and youth organization “Ark” says, “We are facing a catastrophe.” “Ark” looks after 7,000 children and young people from socially disadvantaged families every day in 33 facilities across the country. It is one of the largest aid organizations in the country.\n\nMore than 60% of the protégés have a so-called migration background. Muslim young people are radicalizing more and faster than ever before. “I have never experienced anything like this,” says Büscher. “Militant anti-Semitism” is sometimes a nice way of describing it. \n\n“First we cut the throats of the Jews, then the gays, and finally the Christians,” a young Arab recently told him. Büscher tried to counteract this with small gestures: \n\nHe pinned a small Israel flag on the lapel of his jacket. A 12-year-old saw this and then told the social worker: “I hate you. We’ll take the country back.”\n\n“Bild” newspaper shows that since the Hamas terrorist group massacred 1,200 Israelis, open hatred of Jews has become the norm in German schoolyards. “The integration went wrong. We hardly reach young people anymore,” says Herford teacher Birgit Ebel.\n\nShe reports that radical organizations — such as the Muslim Brotherhood or the extremist Turkish “Gray Wolves” — systematically try to recruit young people near schools and mosques.\n\nApparently with success: When Ebel observed a pro-Hamas rally and spotted some of her students in the demonstration, they shouted to their teacher: “Ms. Ebel, you Jewish whore.”\n\nBüscher says he sees little chance of reaching Muslim young people. “With the very young, conversations can still work. It no longer works for older teenagers. They reject our culture, our values,” he says.\n\nAnd the man for whom youth welfare was his life’s work then adds, visibly depressed: “The hatred is unimaginable.”\n\nAren’t these the guardians of “good and evil” who shouted that we have room? Or does the sentence apply again, as it did after the lost final victory in 1945… or the findings after the great pandemic?\n\nEvery thinking person could have predicted this development since 2015 at the latest. I assume that this Mr. Wolfgang Büscher and Ms. Birgit Ebel were at the forefront of defaming AfD politicians and their supporters as Nazis. \n\nIt is exactly this type of person who, with the best of intentions, does exactly the wrong thing because they DO NOT THINK further than their feelings. \n\nThey are probably only now starting to think about what they (the do-gooders) did wrong in their integration work and how they can change it for the better of society. \n\nRest assured, they have only made one mistake in that regard, and that is to believe that Muslims, who despise us and our culture, can be integrated into our way of life. Just as they will not be able to turn a wolf into a vegetarian, they will not be able to integrate Muslims into Western society. \n\nAlthough I’m pretty sure that their solution will be that Muslims don’t have to integrate with us; that’s not necessary, but that we need to integrate with THEM.\n\nI say NO, we will not bow to those who want to do us harm. The consequence for Muslims must be that they have to leave our countries, period. \n\nAfter all, you don’t let a fox spend the night in the chicken coop, even if there are 1,000 hens in there, now, do you?"
