        "text": "Rashid Khalidi is the most prominent Palestinian-American. He is friends with Barak Obama and teaches history at Columbia. I've read all his writings since I was in college. I used to subscribe to his position, until I grew up. I'd be happy to debate Khalidi one day, if he thinks an immortal like him should debate a mortal like me.\n\nUntil that happens, I watched his most recent interview (90 minutes), and this statement of his caught my eye: \"[Jews] who came didn't come to live with the residents of the country [Ottoman provinces, then Mandate Palestine]. They didn't come to live with the Arabs. They didn't want to learn Arabic or take the citizenship.\"\n\nI've always been a proud Arab. One day, during the peak of the Syrian revolution against the Assad tyranny, I was moderating a panel for Syrian opposition speakers. One of them, an Assyrian, said \"Syria was designed for the Arabs only and never treated us as citizens with equal rights. The name of the country is the Syrian Arab Republic. The official language is Arabic. The national anthem says that Syria is the Den of Arabism, and from us came the Walid [Islamic conquest general Khalid Ibn Al-Walid] and the Rashid [Baghdad Islamic Caliph Haroun Al-Rashid].\"\n\nThat was the first time that I noticed that Arabism was neither neutral nor secular. Arabism is cultural heritage. Islam is even a narrower identity than Arabism. Neither can serve as a national identity.  \n\nAssyrians are mostly Christians who speak Syriac, a Semitic language older than Arabic (it is believed that Syria is named after their civilization). To them, Arab Islamic conquests decimated their culture and homeland. The Arab and Muslim majority of Syrians wants Assyrians as citizens, but Arabized and preferably Islamized. This is is exactly what Khalidi wants Jews who moved from Europe to Palestine to have done: Learn Arabic, become Arab, not have your own national state with your own Jewish heritage.\n\nMany years later (after moderating the panel with the Assyrian Syrian), I read some of the debate of the Jewish Enlightenment, Haskalah. Iraqi Jews debated whether they should learn the revived Hebrew or stick to their Arabic tongue. The argument for Hebrew and against Arabic won. Arabic-speaking Jews said that they disliked when their names were Arabized (Musa instead of Moshe for Moses). Jews also did not appreciate praying in one language and living their lives in another, arguing that their youth were not using Hebrew outside of religious service, and hence that threatened millennia of their written and oral heritage and tradition.\n\nBut here you have Khalidi, a prominent historian, blaming Jews -- without blinking -- for not Arabizing. And he's being generous here. When you add the Palestine emblem (Dome of the Rock) and Basic Law (Arab Palestinian people is part of the Arab nation, Islam is the official religion and a source of legislation), you will further understand why non-Arabs and non-Muslims -- including Jews, Christians, Druze, Kurds, Copts and others -- want their own states. Arab countries, including Palestine, were conceived as monolithic Arab and Islamic, and never tolerated the existence of other identities. \n\nAt the London Conference in 1939 (when Britain abandoned Jews in favor of Arabs), the Jews proposed to the Arabs a binational state, with each community practicing autonomy. The Arabs refused, and told Jews that they can live in Palestine as an Arabic-speaking religious minority, like Jews were living in Iraq. \n\nAnd Khalidi talks for 90 minutes, about history and the inevitability of the end of Israel, but never notices why Israel MUST exist: As long as Khalidi and the Arabs and Muslims cannot offer multi-ethnic, multicultural, tolerant societies and countries based on liberty and equality, non-Arabs and non-Muslims have every right to demand their own sovereign nations. Israel MUST exist. --END \n\nhttps://t.co/TX280kNoPg"

In an extraordinary decision, when he realizes that the massacre is near and he hears cries of pain around him, he bravely decides to come out of his hiding place and take care of the wounded. A friend who hid with him at first said that he saw Dvir running with a stretcher in his hand. The friend yelled at him to get into the car and they would run away and Dvir replied: \"I can't!! I have another friend left inside\". At 07:07 he called his mother and said: \"Mom, there is a lot of shooting, missiles and alarms here. We evacuated two wounded women with open stomachs, I did a tourniquet\" and hung up. Exactly an hour later, he rang again. With shooting and explosions in the background, he said: \"Mom, the situation here is really not good. I see two white vans, full of armed terrorists, wearing military uniforms and shooting everywhere\". Then he shouted: \"Mom, Mom!\" and hung up the phone. At 8:42, Dvir sent a message on the family WhatsApp: \"If I don't get out of this alive, Know that I love you forever. You are my heart\". At 8:54 Dvir sent the last message in the group of friends: \"I love you my friends, my brothers. If I don't get out of this alive, know that I loved you very much. I'm afraid to die. Hear Israel, God, our God, God is one\". The terrorists arrived, Dvir tried to hide with a few other people. One of the terrorists shot him with 2 accurate bullets, took his phone, and answered the call. Dvir's friend across the line asked: \"Dvir Rahamim?\" The terrorist answered: \"There is no Rahamim here, it's Muhammad\". Four days later they found him dumped in the field, near a tree, with several other dead people. This is a story about Dvir, who was supposed to start studying psychology in October, he said he wanted to help people. And there, in Nova, He did exactly what his heart told him. Helped people and was brutally murdered. The hero who will never return, Dvir Rahamim. This is his last picture, dancing, happy at the Nova festival"

They had a common tattoo on their arm and also a common goal: a big trip to South America planned for November. To fulfill the dream, the two worked as waitresses in a restaurant. They went to the Nova music festival to say goodbye to their friends before the trip. But on October 7, the monsters of Hamas put an end to all their dreams. Karina and Maya will never travel in Argentina like they planned.  Long days passed until their bodies were identified, and then the message came: Karina and Maya were murdered. Hopes are over, lives are cut short. Karina and Maya came to celebrate life and will never return."

It won’t happen to me.”\n\nHere we go again…\n\nNever again is now. Time to read the writings on the wall.\n\nHow tragic. 💔\n\nThen and now. \n\nThe top picture? Germany, 1940. \nThe bottom? Rome last week. \n\nSame hatred, same poison, same Nazi salute. \n\n🥺\n\nOne thing, however, is not the same and that is the existence of the modern state of Israel and the ability to defend ourselves with one of the strongest armies in the world. \n\nAnd so, in the most ironic way, those Nazi sympathizers? Those marching for the destruction of the Jewish state? Those very people are the biggest Zionists of all because while there are even some Jews who don’t agree Israel should exist, those ‘Anti Zionists’ remind us all why Israel MUST exist. \n\nSo to all you Jew haters out there, I would like to, on behalf of Jews and Zionists worldwide, thank you for the important reminder that Zionism is necessary and the war against those who want Israel’s destruction, is the most just war in modern history. \n\nAntisemitism is the most effective reminder of why Zionism is necessary and why Israel must fight for its continued existence. \n\n🇮🇱💪✡️🙏"

        "text": "Shown in this 1824 edition of The Modern Traveler, #British journeymen repeatedly explored the Land of Israel (a/k/a Palestine) in the early 1800s where they always wrote of their observations of Jews.\n\nJews were mostly poor & mistreated, but they never abandoned their homeland. \n\nStill other #Jews had been consistently returning (making Aliyah) to Israel for millennia since the end of the Jews’ Third Revolt against the Romans in 135 CE.\n\nThough modern political #Zionism - the belief that Jews have a right to self-determination in at least part of their ancient homeland - did not go fully mainstream as the national liberation movement of the #Jewish people until Thedor Herzl’s Der Judenstaat in 1896, the yearning for & imagining of the Jewish future has always centered on the return of #Jewish sovereignty in Israel.\n\nEvery year on Passover for centuries, Jews said the words, “Next year in #Jerusalem!”\n\nIt has always been the Jewish dream.\n\nAnd repeatedly saying this phrase every year, while also facing Jerusalem every time a Jew prayed, helped provide the conditions for the maintenance of a cohesive national Jewish identity that survived more than 1,800 of diaspora across the globe.\n\nBooks like The Modern Traveler always note the presence of Jews & other groups such as “Turks, Syrians, Bedouin #Arabs … #Latin, #Greek, and #Armenian #Christians, Copts, and Dru[ze].”\n\nOne people you will never find named, however, is anyone called “#Palestinians” or “#Palestinian Arabs.” That identity simply did not exist anywhere in the world at that time. In fact, the identity did not go mainstream among Arabs living in the Land of Israel until after the 1967 Six Day War.\n\nAs The Modern Traveler also notes, the vast majority of the #Arab population did not have roots in the Land & were instead “nomadic … [t]he true Arab is always an inhabitant of the desert” - a reference to the desert of the #Arabian Peninsula.\n\nIn fact, The Modern Traveler notes as many as 10,000 out of a population of ~20,000 people in Jerusalem were Jews (despite the fact that the Land’s far-away rulers from the #Turkish #Ottoman Empire did not technically permit more than 2,000 Jews to live in Jerusalem, this rule was not enforced at the time). Another 5,000 were #Muslims & 5,000 were Christians.\n\nZionism - despite being a word that has been severely misused by, and turned into some sort of insult by, anti-Israel groups seeking to ignore & remove the Jews' ancient & constant connection with the Land of Israel - is at the very essence of what it means, and has always meant, to be a #Jew.\n\n#Education #Israel #Palestine",

Fact or fiction?\n\nThe claim that Israel is the indigenous land of the Jewish nation is supported by historical, archaeological, and genealogical evidence. Archaeological findings suggest that Jewish life can be traced back in the region for thousands of years, with more than 30,000 sites in Israel containing antiquities dating back centuries[5]. The Jewish people have maintained ties to their historic homeland for more than 3,700 years, with a national language and a distinct civilization[9]. \n\nHistorically, the Jewish people achieved sovereignty in the region multiple times, with the ancient history of the land of Israel including many centuries during which the land was governed by Jewish kingdoms[3]. The Jewish people base their claim to the land of Israel on several premises, including the promise of the land to the patriarch Abraham, the settlement and development of the land by the Jewish people, and the international community granting political sovereignty in British Mandate Palestine to the nation of Israel[9].\n\nGenealogically, recent studies support the notion that a significant percentage of Jewish males and females can trace their ancestry to the Middle East[1]. The Jewish religion, language, culture, holidays, rituals, liturgy, and history are all deeply connected to the Land of Israel[11].\n\nIn conclusion, based on historical, archaeological, and genealogical evidence, it can be stated that Jews have a deep-rooted connection to the land of Israel, and are indigenous to the region.\n\nCitations:\n[1] Are Jews Indigenous to the Land of Israel?

Doron was hardworking man, always smiling, quiet and pleasant. Doron went through hell, he saw the worst horrors in front of him. He saw a massacre. He was kidnapped from the festival site and taken in the wagon of a terrorist van. Families with children abducted from the kibbutzim were already sitting in the cart. Doron found himself in an impossible situation, surrounded by crying babies and armed terrorists. Around them were hundreds of terrorists who were beating them from all sides - he spread his big hands and wrapped the little girls of the Asher family, and spoke to them in his heart. Doron protected the frightened girls and ministered to them a calm that humanity did not know. They arrived at the border as a van stopped. The terrorists began to separate parents from children, between men and women. When the children were taken from their parents, Doron couldn't take it anymore. His big heart broke and he pushed a terrorist to the floor. At that moment 3 shots, Doron was murdered in front of everyone and remained lying there next to the border fence as the terrorists continued with the families inside. This good man could not bear the difficult selection, for him it was the end. It's a story about an angel named Doron. An angel in the form of a man, This is a story about his big heart that could be seen through his eyes."

Fact or fiction?\n\nThe claim that Israel is the indigenous land of the Jewish nation is supported by historical, archaeological, and genealogical evidence. Archaeological findings suggest that Jewish life can be traced back in the region for thousands of years, with more than 30,000 sites in Israel containing antiquities dating back centuries[5]. The Jewish people have maintained ties to their historic homeland for more than 3,700 years, with a national language and a distinct civilization[9]. \n\nHistorically, the Jewish people achieved sovereignty in the region multiple times, with the ancient history of the land of Israel including many centuries during which the land was governed by Jewish kingdoms[3]. The Jewish people base their claim to the land of Israel on several premises, including the promise of the land to the patriarch Abraham, the settlement and development of the land by the Jewish people, and the international community granting political sovereignty in British Mandate Palestine to the nation of Israel[9].\n\nGenealogically, recent studies support the notion that a significant percentage of Jewish males and females can trace their ancestry to the Middle East[1]. The Jewish religion, language, culture, holidays, rituals, liturgy, and history are all deeply connected to the Land of Israel[11].\n\nIn conclusion, based on historical, archaeological, and genealogical evidence, it can be stated that Jews have a deep-rooted connection to the land of Israel, and are indigenous to the region.\n\nCitations:\n[1] Are Jews Indigenous to the Land of Israel?
