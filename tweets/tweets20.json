Before their departure, Rabbi Posner was able to convince many of his congregants to leave as well and indeed most managed to leave for Eretz Israel or the United States.

A few days after sending the invitations I received a mail from someone not invited from @RadioCanadaInfo. She thanked me for the invite but, she wrote, no one could attend as Radio Canada was busy that day.\n¬†\nSomeone not from Radio Canada, with no knowledge of the mail I had received, told me Radio Canada held some form of executive meeting and decided no-one from Radio Canada would participate in the screening. ‚ÄúThey want to remain neutral‚Äù he told me (he called it a BS position). Another person, also not from Radio Canada, asked me why Radio Canada had not participated. I got the clear impression he too knew of Radio Canada‚Äôs decision to avoid exposure to significant and relevant material on a subject they are giving extensive coverage to.\n¬†\nI replied to Radio Canada‚Äôs mail, suggesting they choose a day and time convenient and I would arrange a special screening for them. A week later I sent a reminder mail. Another week has passed and still no response. I can only conclude that the two people who made it clear to me that Radio Canada objected to viewing the unreleased footage were correct and the Radio Canada employee who politely told me they were busy at the time was just too embarrassed to be honest.\n¬†\nI have been contacted by more than one Radio Canada journalist asking whether the rumour is true that Radio Canada ‚Äúboycotted‚Äù the screening and asking whether I could invite them to a future screening. The offer remains - should Radio Canada wish to see significant and relevant material on a subject they are giving extensive coverage to, I will arrange a screening for them.

A Gazan says the following, referring to Sinwar's decision to not release any Israeli hostage - no matter the cost - and to continue fighting to the last man:\n\"What decision?! What decision?!\nSurrender now, no more of this!\nThis is utter stupidity! What Sinwar is doing is utter stupidity!\nHe killed his own nation! Sinwar killed his own nation!\"\n\nNote that the man is talking directly to the camera, without hiding his face. This shows the big paradigm shift happening within Gaza. Hamas is known for torturing and killing its political opponents and any who criticise it.\n\nWhat this man is saying would have been a death sentence just a few months ago, and it still is extremely dangerous."
