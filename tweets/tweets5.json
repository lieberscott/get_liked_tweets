On the morning of October 7th in Shlomo's house in Kibbutz Nahal Oz his wife Hana, daughters and grandson were sleeping, he was supposed to undergo surgery and they wanted to accompany him, when the terrorists entered  the Kibbutz, Shlomo decided to do something you only see in movies. Shlomo told the family members to enter the shelter, lock the door and be quiet. But he himself did not enter it. He knew that if the terrorists came and saw an elderly man sitting alone on the sofa, they would think that there was no one else at home and so it was. His nanny said they argued with him and called him to come in and he didn't agree. \"Hana, hide, I'll watch over you\", Shlomo sat down on the sofa, the monsters came and shot dozens of bullets at him, he just stayed sitting. They assumed that because he was sitting there, dead, alone, the apartment was empty, and they moved on and did not enter. Later, more terrorists kept coming, seeing that an elderly man was sitting dead on the sofa and did not enter. They assumed he was alone there. And thus, in this act, Shlomo saved his family. It's a story about an 85-year-old hero who with unimaginable nobility sat on a couch and waited for the angel of death. It is a story about Shlomo, who believed in life and ended his life cruelly, alone, on the couch of his home. Not armed, not in battle, just in his silence, he was full of courage and composure in the face of the monsters that came to his house. The monsters could not defeat his great love for his family. Under the sky and freedom of birds, he was buried in Kinneret."

        "text": "📣EXPOSED! Vile Anti-Semite Jackson Hinkle, who once described himself as an \"American Conservative Marxist-Leninist\", is nothing but a scammer, grifter, con artist and an opportunist, scamming people out of their hard earned money, to pay him, for his opinions. \n\nThe 24 year old, repeatedly claims he's being, \"silenced\" and \"censored\" on X, despite no evidence at all, of that being the case; to make his followers pay for his \"content\".\n\nHinkle, having formally been a \"marketing specialist\", has applied his experience in marketing, to rebrand himself, several times in just a few years, depending on what the biggest money making cause, can be for himself.\n\nHe started out in the environmentalist movement, particularly its subsidiary antinuclear movement, playing the role of a bleeding heart liberal. He was seen taking a knee with BLM, protesting the death of George Floyd. \n\nHinkle infamously tried running for San Clemente City Council. During his election campaign, he campaigned heavily on defunding the police. Ultimately Hinkle lost his election bid, transforming himself into a failed politician. Later on he shifted gears, by rebranding himself as a Bernie Sanders, “democrat socialist\".\n\nHowever, nowadays he's rebranded himself as a \"MAGA communist\", despite the fact that, the majority of the MAGA movement is firmly, anti- communist. Hinkle's contradictory politics are confusing. He's not just a pro-Russian American patriot, but a\n\"God fearing\" Marxist-Leninist. He doesn't see any issue with his conservative Marxism, explaining that \"Communism and Marxism historically have been Conservative\". \n\nIn his most recent scam, he's pivoted to X, claiming that \"Zionists\" are trying to silence him and asks people to subscribe to his premium, for three dollars a month. He's been cought lying numerous times, claiming that he's \"exposing\", Zionist lies. \n\nIn a post which received over five million views, Hinkle announced that Israel had lied about the events of October 7th. Only 900 died, he said, half of whom were Israeli soldiers. Babies were never killed, and Israeli soldiers were taken, respectfully, to morgues by Hamas.\nHe's been community noted on his posts, numerous times, but that won't stop the con-artist from scamming his followers. \n\nHe's been a strong supporter of the Hamas terrorist organization, which calls for the killing of all Jews worldwide. Since the beginning of the Israel- Gaza war, he's disgracefully mocked the Jewish hostages, kidnapped by Hamas, posting vile images mocking these heroes. He's posted many images, condoning the Hamas killings and kidnappings. \n\nJackson Hinkle also has a Persian-language Telegram channel, being promoted by an IRGC-affiliated Telegram channel. His Iranian ties are very concerning, with many speculating, that Iran is giving him mass cash handouts, to promote antisemitism and Jew hatred.\n\nOthers have posted about Qatar sending him upwards of $30000 dollars a month, to promote terrorist and Hamas propaganda. This rumor has yet to be confirmed. \n\nHe recently got engaged to, Anna Linnikova, the 23 year old winner of \"Miss Russia\". Anna had been seen advertised as an escort in Dubai, with many speculating, that that's were the couple met. \n\nThe engagement was short lived however, because as soon as she got to know Hinkle, she immediately DUMPED him like a hot potato. She referred to him, on Instagram, as an abuser,\" a \"manipulator\" and even a \"narcissist\". To one fan, she said, \"I'm so happy I'm not with a narcissistic manipulator.\" She's also referred to him as being \"broke\" and having a micro-penis. \n\n👉 Please LIKE and SHARE this expose."

It's a story about Daniel who came to the Nova Music Festival to dance and found himself in a battle against an RPG when he was unarmed. When the terrorists infiltrated the Nova festival, Daniel did not run away. He stayed, he saw his friends fall one after another. He saw the rifle bullets pierce their hearts. He decided to treat, to save lives. He didn't realize that the monsters weren't going to leave anyone alive. Faced with the dangers, he treated, and until his last moments he was seen in an ambulance on the party grounds, fighting for the life of a young woman who had been shot. Nothing was left of the ambulance and near it, the bodies were almost unrecognizable. No one survived. Several days will pass until his parents are informed - Daniel was brutally murdered. It's a story about a guy who couldn't die, he believed in life and people. This is a story about his heart that was too big to give up. This is a story about Daniel's kind eyes that looked with compassion on a helpless wounded woman begging for her life, and he chose to hold her hand until the last moment."

I was in the minority that said No War. There was no war.\n\nSince October 7, the same cast -- US pundit world and Prog politicians -- insisted that #Israel cannot destroy Hamas. Again, I'm with the minority that says that Israel is slowly, but surely, incinerating Hamas, to the last terrorist. When Israel is done. Hamas will be history, parked next to Saddam and his Baath, Bin Laden and his Al-Qaeda, Baghdadi (like a dog) and ISIS. Of course, millions of crazy Arabs and Palestinians still love Saddam and will continue to love Hamas, but only as a memory. \n\nIsrael has so far killed 20 (or 21, I think one needs an update) of the top 54 Hamas leaders. Israel will get all 54.\n\nWish those Arabs and Palestinians who wasted time and energy trying to avert Hamas's inevitable doom invested the same energy in turning Arabs and Palestinians against Hamas. That'd have made uprooting it smoother and less destructive for everyone. Remember, Israel is not fond of losing its best and brightest on the front. But in a neighborhood as tough as the Mideast, if your enemies ever smell blood, they will not show you any mercy."

Vile Anti-Semite Jackson Hinkle, who once described himself as an \"American Conservative Marxist-Leninist\", is nothing but a scammer, grifter, con artist and an opportunist, scamming people out of their hard earned money, to pay him, for his opinions. \n\nThe 24 year old, repeatedly claims he's being, \"silenced\" and \"censored\" on X, despite no evidence at all, of that being the case; to make his followers pay for his \"content\".\n\nHinkle, having formally been a \"marketing specialist\", has applied his experience in marketing, to rebrand himself, several times in just a few years, depending on what the biggest money making cause, can be for himself.\n\nHe started out in the environmentalist movement, particularly its subsidiary antinuclear movement, playing the role of a bleeding heart liberal. He was seen taking a knee with BLM, protesting the death of George Floyd. \n\nHinkle infamously tried running for San Clemente City Council. During his election campaign, he campaigned heavily on defunding the police. Ultimately Hinkle lost his election bid, transforming himself into a failed politician. Later on he shifted gears, by rebranding himself as a Bernie Sanders, “democrat socialist\".\n\nHowever, nowadays he's rebranded himself as a \"MAGA communist\", despite the fact that, the majority of the MAGA movement is firmly, anti- communist. Hinkle's contradictory politics are confusing. He's not just a pro-Russian American patriot, but a\n\"God fearing\" Marxist-Leninist. He doesn't see any issue with his conservative Marxism, explaining that \"Communism and Marxism historically have been Conservative\". \n\nIn his most recent scam, he's pivoted to X, claiming that \"Zionists\" are trying to silence him and asks people to subscribe to his premium, for three dollars a month. He's been cought lying numerous times, claiming that he's \"exposing\", Zionist lies. \n\nIn a post which received over five million views, Hinkle announced that Israel had lied about the events of October 7th. Only 900 died, he said, half of whom were Israeli soldiers. Babies were never killed, and Israeli soldiers were taken, respectfully, to morgues by Hamas.\nHe's been community noted on his posts, numerous times, but that won't stop the con-artist from scamming his followers. \n\nHe's been a strong supporter of the Hamas terrorist organization, which calls for the killing of all Jews worldwide. Since the beginning of the Israel- Gaza war, he's disgracefully mocked the Jewish hostages, kidnapped by Hamas, posting vile images mocking these heroes. He's posted many images, condoning the Hamas killings and kidnappings. \n\nJackson Hinkle also has a Persian-language Telegram channel, being promoted by an IRGC-affiliated Telegram channel. His Iranian ties are very concerning, with many speculating, that Iran is giving him mass cash handouts, to promote antisemitism and Jew hatred.\n\nOthers have posted about Qatar sending him upwards of $30000 dollars a month, to promote terrorist and Hamas propaganda. This rumor has yet to be confirmed. \n\nHe recently got engaged to, Anna Linnikova, the 23 year old winner of \"Miss Russia\". Anna had been seen advertised as an escort in Dubai, with many speculating, that that's were the couple met. \n\nThe engagement was short lived however, because as soon as she got to know Hinkle, she immediately DUMPED him like a hot potato. She referred to him, on Instagram, as an abuser,\" a \"manipulator\" and even a \"narcissist\". To one fan, she said, \"I'm so happy I'm not with a narcissistic manipulator.\" She's also referred to him as being \"broke\" and having a micro-penis. \n\n👉 Please LIKE and SHARE this expose."
