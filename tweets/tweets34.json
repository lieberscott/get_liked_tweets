Israel has offered to share the land FIVE TIMES -- the two-state solution: You have your state, and we'll have ours.\n\nIf the Palestinians also wanted a state, everything would be good. But, as Wilf points out, they don't - or they would have taken one of the FIVE offers for a shared state. But they make it clear in public statements: Their desire is not to have a state but for Israel NOT to have state, and they are willing to do as medieval Islamic texts command them: mass-murder Jews in hopes of seeing that they eradicate all Jews on the land. \n\nTHIS, terrorist-enablers with your \"Free Palestine\" shouts, is what you are calling for: mass slaughter of Jews. THIS is genocide. Not Israel offering to share the land, with 20% of its population Muslim Arab citizens with the same full rights and benefits as Jewish citizens.   Not Israel, which cares for numerous Palestinians in its hospitals, curing their cancer, saving their at-risk pregnancies, and so much more. \n\nPalestinian children are raised on the sick evil that their greatest value in life is to die while murdering Jews. THIS is what you are supporting, all of those calling for Israel's suicide with the seemingly \"polite\" language of \"ceasefire.\" Hamas has promised continued Oct 7s. Loudly, publicly -- from their official leaders (living in luxury in Qatar and elsewhere on stolen aid billions while they call for the gullible Palestinians to die murdering Jews). \n\nAs Golda Meir said, \"Peace will come when the Arabs will love their children more than they hate us.\"",

I was speaking to a person who rejects hadith and stated that if you do not accept the hadith it is easy to come to this conclusion. Having said this, both  Sunni and Shia Muslims DO NOT accept only the Quran but believe in the Quran and HADITH. My view, as stated in the video, is that people should get married when they are capable both mentally and physically and that this is understood through specialists like doctors. The modern day idea that adulthood starts at 16 or 18 is an arbitrary social construct. Having said this, I do not advocate that anyone break the law in any country that they are in and get married before these ages. Notice also the title of the video in question 'extreme consequences of believing the Quran only'\n\nHere is the full video: https://t.co/mVzIkLKhAT",

If it was \"eye for an eye\", Israel could have wiped Gaza off the map. Just like the U.S wiped out Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the Japanese savage attack on Pearl Harbor. When a society reaches a moral rock bottom validating savage ideologies, the use of lethal force becomes a necessity to restore order. Dropping dirty bombs in certain situations could be the only way to end the war."

It would bring the human costs of war home to the public. But as it turns out, the media *only* does this when Israel is at war. Even when the US is at war, the American media doesn't do this (do you recall the Washington Post having an Iraqi or Afghan casualty meter during those American wars?), and you could say the same for every country in the world. So the underlying reason the media does this reflects one of two ideas. First, that Israel's legitimacy is conditional in the way that no other country's legitimacy is conditional. Second, that there is a particular problem with Jews, as opposed to anyone else, using military force. The two notions are of course not mutually exclusive."
