As you can see in this video (link below) senior Hamas leader Fathi Hammad demonstrates how Jews will be treated in \"Free Palestine\".\n\nIn 2005 Gaza was \"free\" after Israel expelled all the Jews and gave the territories to the Palestinian Authority. Sadly, in 2006 the Palestinians in Gaza voted Hamas into power, even though its charter explicitly calls for the genocide of Jews. Israel was forced to defend itself after Hamas began terrorizing Israeli civilians in the south. We didn't build a wall and security fences \"just for fun\". \n\nThis video and the terrorist attack on October 7th make the intentions of Hamas very clear. Hamas terrorists don't want a state alongside the State of Israel. They want a state instead of the State of Israel.\nHamas terrorists do not want \"coexistence\" with the Jews as they publicly and explicitly call for genocide and ethnic cleansing of Jews.\n\nLink to the video: https://t.co/bLM4ekVJ3E\n\nPlease retweet if you support Israel's right to exist and defend itself!"

Israel is forced to negotiate with the twisted leaders of Hamas for our children only because so many people in official and non official positions of power failed to do their job and normalized the idea that kidnapping children from their beds and keeping them as bargaining chips is somehow a legitimate act that leads to negotiations rather than to stringent condemnation and global ostracism."

This was widely dismissed by critics of Israel.\n\n-Biden confirmed out of his own mouth at a live press conference that it is a fact that Hamas has headquarters at al-Shifa hospital.   This made little impression and was dismissed by critics as being based on Israeli intel and misinformation.\n\n-The IDF displayed a good quantity of weaponry captured at the hospital - and was accused by critics of rearranging it and mocked for the purportedly underwhleming findings (including a laptop with info on a hostage).  Bases of ridicule included that there were weapons in a room with an MRI machine.\n\n-The IDF produced CCTV footage of gunmen bringing hostages into the hospital.  This was widely dismissed as evidence of Hamas caring for casualties and/or fake (including on the basis of a wall clock in the footage not synchronizing with the video timestamp).\n\n-The IDF unearthed a tunnel entrance leading to a secured metal door.  This was described as a well and as part of a basement built by Israel and/or fake.\n\n-The IDF breached the door and has now displayed extensive footage of a large underground complex including rooms with electric and plumbing and a labyrinth of tunnels clearly in the Hamas style of tunnel construction.   And IDF forensic work at the hospital is ongoing!   Still, this is not taken as conclusive evidence of a significant Hamas presence, indeed, this story is just being ignored.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf there is information that makes Israel look bad, it will be given massive immediate credence .\n\nIf there is information that makes Israel look good, it will be rationalized out of existence or ignored.\n\nInsofar as Israel is concerned, this dynamic applies widely."

During the 30 years between the Ottoman Empire‚Äôs defeat in 1918 & Israel declaring independence in 1948, there were many opportunities for peace.\n\n1918 - First Meeting Between #Zionist & Arab Leaders\n\nAt Aqaba, Zionist leader Dr. Chaim Weizmann first met Emir Feisal (photo below) - son of the Grand Sharif of #Mecca, ruler of the Hejaz, direct descendant of #Mohammed, leader of the #Arab revolt against the Ottomans & by far the most well-known & respected Arab leader of the early 20th century.\n\nFeisal knew that what he called ‚ÄúSouthern #Syria‚Äù (referred to by the British as ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù & by the Jews as ‚ÄúEretz Israel‚Äù) had become a neglected, largely barren, arid, malarial-swamp-infested wasteland under the Ottomans & felt the #Jewish zeal to revitalize the Land would benefit both Jews & Arabs.\n\n1919 - #Paris Peace Conference\n\nThe Paris Peace Conference convened to discuss post-war peace terms & how land of the former Ottoman Empire & Imperial #Germany would be divided.\n\nEmir Feisal represented Arab interests at the Conference\n\nJan 1919: Weizmann-Feisal Agreement Signed\n\nDr. Weizmann and Emir Feisal, in Jan 1919, signed an Agreement acknowledging:\n\n‚Äúthe racial kinship & ancient bonds existing between the Arabs & the Jewish people‚Äù and mutually recognizing the Balfour Declaration by declaring ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù the Jewish National Home on which ‚Äú[a]ll necessary measures will be taken to encourage and stimulate #immigration of Jews into Palestine on a large scale, and as quickly as possible to settle Jewish immigrants upon the land through closer settlement and intensive cultivation of the soil.‚Äù\n\nMarch 1919: Feisal & Frankfurter Exchange Letters\n\nAfter a meeting between Emir Feisal & Zionist leader Felix Frankfurter in March 1919, Feisal drafted & signed a letter to Frankfurter with the Arab position:\n\n‚ÄúWe feel that the Arabs & Jews are cousins by race, suffering similar oppression at the hands of powers stronger than themselves, & by happy coincidence have been able to take the first step towards the attainment of their national ideals together. We Arabs, especially the educated among us, look with the deepest sympathy on the Zionist movement ‚Ä¶ we regard [the Zionist proposals] ‚Ä¶ as moderate and proper ‚Ä¶ [and] wish the Jews a most hearty welcome home ‚Ä¶ The Jewish movement is national and not imperialist ‚Ä¶ there is room in Syria for us both. Indeed I think that neither can be a real success without the other.‚Äù\n\nFrankfurter replied to Feisal in a letter acknowledging the Arab position ‚Äúwith deep appreciation‚Äù & stating:\n\n‚Äú[W]e knew that the aspirations of the Arab and the Jewish peoples were parallel, that each aspired to re-establish its nationality in its own homeland ‚Ä¶ The Arabs and Jews are neighbors in territory; we cannot but live side by side as friends.‚Äù\n\nApr 4-7 1920 - Violent Nebi Musa Riots & Their Rejection By Several Arab Leaders\n\nWhile the policy of the #British government was pro-Zionist & pro-Arab, certain British officers on the ground were deeply #antisemitic & worked to foment Arab violence against Jews.\n\nSpecifically, British Colonel Waters Taylor (financial advisor to Military Administration in Palestine), met with Arab extremist Amin al-Husseini & encouraged him to incite a riot during Easter to show the Arabs did not support #Zionism.\n\nFor four straight days, al-Husseini‚Äôs incited mob of ~65,000 Arabs engaged in a riotous #pogrom against the Jewish community in #Jerusalem.\n\nThe mob chanted things like, ‚Äúslaughter the Jews,‚Äù ‚Äúthe Jews are our dogs,‚Äù and ‚Äúwe will drink Jewish blood,‚Äù as they destroyed & looted Jewish shops, homes, & synagogues and then raped and murdered their way through the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem‚Äôs Old City.\n\nAs horrifying as the riots were, not all hope was lost as Arab sheikhs from 82 villages around Jaffa & Jerusalem (who claimed to represent 70% of the population) published a document fully condemning the Arab riots & violence against Jews & expressly proclaiming Zionism was ‚Äúnot a danger‚Äù to Arabs.\n\nApril 20, 1920 - San Remo Conference\n\nAt the San Remo Conference, Ottoman & German colonies were split into 15 legal mandates awarded to the Allied powers.\n\nOne of those mandates was the British Mandate for Palestine (containing all of modern day Israel, #Gaza, the #WestBank, & the country of #Jordan), which expressly required the British to hold the land in trust while encouraging Jewish immigration to the Land on which there would be a reconstituted Jewish National Home.\n\nFeb 1921 - Churchill meets Jewish & Arab leaders in Palestine\n\nWinston Churchill was put in charge of Britain‚Äôs Palestine policy by Prime Minister David Lloyd George & he visited the Land to meet with Jewish & Arab leaders in Feb 1921.\n\nChurchill was stunned by the degree to which the Jews had already developed the land & built large, fully-functioning communities over the prior decades; he also marked the groundbreaking ceremony for #Hebrew University in Jerusalem.\n\nDays later, Churchill met with Arab leaders - only those with whom he met were led by another member of the al-Husseini clan, Musa Kazem al-Husseini.\n\nChurchill was stunned as he listed to the Arabs read aloud a 39-page memorandum filled almost exclusively with hatred, demonization, & absurd conspiracy theories about Jews and world domination.\n\nChurchill expressed his disapproval & told the Arab leaders in attendance it was ‚Äúmanifestly right that the Jews should have a National Home ‚Ä¶ [a]nd where else could that be but in this land of Palestine, with which for more than 3,000 years they have been intimately & profoundly associated? ‚Ä¶ [W]e also think it will be good for the Arabs who dwell in Palestine.‚Äù\n\nMarch 1921 - British Commission Empowers al-Husseini & Terror Ensues\n\nThe British Commission in Palestine appointed Amin al-Husseini ‚ÄúGrand Mufti‚Äù - a position that did not previously exist (‚Äúmufti‚Äù existed, but not ‚Äúgrand mufti‚Äù), and that gave him lifelong tenure as the most prominent Arab leader in Palestine.\n\nAl-Husseini almost immediately instigated organized ‚Äúfedayeen‚Äù terror attacks against the Jewish community culminating with riots in Jaffa and Petah Tikvah that left 43 Jews dead only three weeks later.\n\nFollowing the riots, al-Husseini consolidated his power & took control of all #Muslim religious funds, the mosques, the schools, & the courts. He then wrote to Churchill & demanded an end to Jewish immigration & for Palestine to be ‚Äúreunited with Syria.‚Äù\n\n1922 - Mandate made Official & the First Partition of Palestine\n\nBy international treaty, in 1922, the League of Nations officially formalized the British Mandate for Palestine, which adopted the Balfour Declaration, acknowledging the Jewish people‚Äôs \"historical connections‚Äù to the Land, & declaring the British requirement to ‚Äúfacilitat[e] Jewish immigration [and] encourage settlement on the land‚Äù while acknowledging the ‚Äúmoral validity of reconstituting‚Äù the Jewish nation.\n\nMeanwhile, Churchill acknowledged a segment of the Palestinian Arab community violently rejected the Jews, but he also received express declarations from hundreds of Palestinian Arab sheikhs & mukhtars supporting Jewish immigration to improve the industrial development of the land, which they said would improve the lives of Arabs as well.\n\nIn an attempt to quell any further violence & Arab anxieties, with the stroke of a pen, Churchill partitioned the British Mandate for Palestine by slicing off 3/4 of the Land (everything east of the Jordan River) to create a new Arab Muslim country called ‚ÄúTrans-Jordan,‚Äù to which Emir Feisal‚Äôs brother, Abdullah (also widely recognized as an Arab Muslim leader from #Saudi Arabia), was named king.\n\nJews were irate at the loss of 75% of the territory promised to them, but ultimately decided to accept Churchill‚Äôs White Paper in the spirit of good will toward their Arab neighbors.\n\nAl-Husseini (who now had his thumb on the majority of Palestine‚Äôs Arabs, especially since most would not dare challenge him lest they be summarily executed) flatly rejected the extremely Arab-friendly partition & said the whole of the land was Arab.\n\nJust one year later, the British were forced to suspend the Palestine Constitution after Al-Husseini refused to participate in the Mandatory government.\n\nAnd al-Husseini continued to organize ongoing violence against Jews culminating in the particularly barbaric 1929 Hebron massacre, which began as a result of the now oft-repeated & nearly 100-year-old lie that the Jews were attempting to ‚Äúdestroy al-Aqsa mosque.‚Äù\n\n1936 - Start of the Arab Revolt\n\nIn April 1936 (3+ years after Hitler first came to power & while the situation of Jews in #Europe was rapidly deteriorating), al-Husseini organized a terror attack on a Jewish bus, which was then followed by three years of organized terror between Palestinian Arab clans & by Arabs against both Jews and the British.\n\nAl-Husseini formed the Arab Higher Committee, declared a national strike & made three demands: (1) cessation of Jewish immigration; (2) end of land sales to Jews; & (3) the establishment of an Arab national government in the whole of Palestine.\n\n1937 - Peel Commission & Recommended Second Partition of Palestine\n\nBritain set up the Peel Commission to investigate the cause of the Arab riots & to make recommendations.\n\nOne of the Jewish Zionist leaders, Ze‚Äôev Jabotinsky, was interviewed by the Commission, & his words were hauntingly prophetic.\n\nJabotinsky told the British the Jews of Europe faced ‚Äúa disaster of historic magnitude ‚Ä¶ We have got to save millions, many millions ‚Ä¶ who are virtually knocking at the door [of Palestine] asking for admission.‚Äù\n\nAs to the Arab population, Jabotinsky was clear there was no Jewish desire to ‚Äúoust‚Äù any Arabs and he further said ‚ÄúPalestine on both sides of the Jordan should hold the Arabs, their progeny, and many millions of Jews.‚Äù\n\nJabotinsky then acknowledged a movement of Palestine‚Äôs Arabs to create yet another Arab state in the land, but he said, ‚Äúwhen the Arab claim is confronted with our Jewish demand to be saved, it is like the claims of appetite versus the claims of starvation.‚Äù\n\nThe Peel Commission ultimately recommended a second partition of Palestine - this time leaving the Jews with only an extraordinarily tiny portion of what is today a sliver of the northwest coast of Israel, and giving the remaining 80% of the land for an Arab state.\n\nThe Jews felt betrayed. But they understood, at least on some level, the disaster awaiting their brethren in Europe & the immediate need to provide safe haven.\n\nSo, the Jews accepted the Peel Commission‚Äôs partition, assuming the Arabs would accept it & agree to live side-by-side in peace.\n\nThis time, not only did al-Husseini reject the planned partition, but neighboring Arab leaders & states did as well.\n\nA Syrian pan-Arab Congress rejected the Peel Commission‚Äôs recommendations & declared its goal to ‚Äúliberat[e] the country and establish[] an Arab government.‚Äù\n\n1938 - Woodhead Commission & the Evian Conference\n\nThe following year, Britain established the Woodhead Commission to study Palestine & try to find borders that both the Jews & Arabs could accept.\n\nThe Woodhead Commission made three proposals, all of which saw the once large Jewish nation continue to shrink exponentially.\n\nIn its report, the Woodhead Commission noted, ‚ÄúArabs of all parties & shades of political opinion were unanimous in condemning the plan as inequitable & wholly unacceptable.‚Äù\n\nThe report further noted that the thought that ‚Äúpeace to Palestine‚Äù would be brought by any partition that included a Jewish state of any size was something ‚Äúwe cannot venture to hope.‚Äù\n\nOne Arab witness interviewed by the Woodhead Commission said if partition is set in motion that creates any Jewish state, ‚Äúyou will have to have a barbed wire right right it ‚Ä¶ with pill boxes every half kilometer ‚Ä¶ Hostility in our lifetime there will be.‚Äù\n\nAnother Arab witness said, ‚ÄúThere would be a violent reaction to anything which gives any part of Palestine to the Jews.‚Äù\n\nOne other Arab witness said that even if a tiny Jewish State was proclaimed, the Arabs might stay quiet at first, but they would merely be ‚Äúbid[ing] their time, that is all‚Äù until the Jewish State would be destroyed.\n\nThe Woodhead Commission declared the Arab position as making the conflict in Palestine ‚Äúirreconcilable.‚Äù\n\nMeanwhile, also in 1938, the Evian Conference was called by U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt in #France to allegedly attempt to deal with the Jewish #refugee problem caused by rise of #Nazi Germany.\n\nAll 32 nations in attendance at the Evian Conference refused to permit any significant immigration of Jews to their country.\n\nThe #Nazis even mocked the world and their ‚Äúfake‚Äù sympathy for the Jews by declaring in Nazi newspaper headlines, ‚ÄúJEWS FOR SALE AT A BARGAIN PRICE‚ÄîWHO WANTS THEM? NO ONE.‚Äù\n\n1939 - St. James Palace Conference & the White Paper\n\nIn February 1939, the British held the St. James Palace Conference in #London to try to find a peaceful solution to the problems in Palestine.\n\nHowever, the Conference was dead on arrival as the Arab delegates refused to meet with their Jewish counterparts.\n\nMeanwhile, just two months later, Britain (then led by anti-Zionist Neville Chamberlain) was preparing for potential war with Germany, acknowledged its dependence on Middle Eastern oil to win that war (thus requiring Arab goodwill), & decided to appease the Arabs.\n\nThe 1939 White Paper was issued, abandoning Britain‚Äôs legal obligations to establish a Jewish State in Palestine & shutting the doors to further Jewish immigration almost entirely.\n\nWhen the British submitted the White Paper to the League of Nations for approval, it was rejected as ‚Äúnot in accordance with ‚Ä¶ the Mandate.‚Äù\n\nBut the world was on the brink of war, and the League of Nations had no enforcement power. So Britain ignored the League of Nations‚Äô decision.\n\nThe Jewish Agency for Palestine called the White Paper a betrayal in the midst of the ‚Äúdarkest hour of Jewish history.‚Äù\n\nZionist leader (and later first Prime Minister of Israel) David Ben-Gurion called the White Paper ‚Äúthe greatest betrayal perpetrated by the government of a civilized people in our generation.‚Äù\n\nDr. Weitzmann called it, ‚Äúa death sentence for the Jewish people.‚Äù\n\nWhen war broke out later that year & the Holocaust ensued, Europe‚Äôs Jews did not have any place on Earth in which they could seek refuge.\n\nMillions of Jews were murdered by the Nazis, but it could be argued they were condemned to their fate by the failure of the Evian Conference and the issuance of the British White Paper.\n\n1945 - End of WWII & the Holocaust\n\nIn 1945, the full extent of Nazi atrocities & their systematic slaughter of 6 million of Europe‚Äôs Jews (2/3 of the population) was revealed to the world.\n\nThose Jews who survived had no homes to which they could return; & there were multiple violent pogroms against the few Jews who tried to go ‚Äúhome.‚Äù\n\nHundreds of thousands of Jews were homeless #refugees & survivors of #Hitler‚Äôs madness; but they could only be put into Displaced Persons camps, which were often in the same location as the Nazi concentration camps in which they had been tortured & where their families had been murdered.\n\nU.S. President Harry Truman was appalled that even in light of the Holocaust & the condition of the surviving displaced refugee Jews, the British refused to end its illegal White Paper policy; and he demanded Britain immediately permit the entry of 100,000 Jewish survivors to Palestine.\n\nBritain, then under the leadership of anti-Zionist Prime Minister Clement Attlee, refused.\n\n1946 - Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry\n\nThe Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry was set up in 1946 to study the Jewish refugee problem & the status of the situation in Palestine and make any recommendations.\n\nThe Committee found the Arab intransigence to any Jewish immigration & to any Jewish state remained; but given Britain‚Äôs legal obligations under the Mandate & the condition of the Jewish refugees in Europe, the Committee recommended the immediate immigration of 100,000 Jews to Palestine to be followed by further steps to arrange a compromise between the Jews & Arabs.\n\n1947 - Britain Abandons the Mandate & Seeks Resolution by the UN\n\nForeign Minister of Britain (and well-known #antisemite) Ernest Bevin declared in Feb 1947 his recommendation that the Mandate be abandoned since ‚Äúthere is no prospect of reaching ‚Ä¶ any settlement which would be even broadly acceptable to the two communities in Palestine.‚Äù\n\nBevin described the ‚Äúirreconcilable‚Äù nature of the conflict to the British House of Commons thusly, ‚ÄúFor the Jews, the essential point of principle is the creation of a sovereign Jewish State. For the Arabs, the essential point of principle is to resist to the last the establishment of a Jewish sovereignty in any part of Palestine.‚Äù\n\nIn May 1947, the UN created the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (‚ÄúUNSCOP‚Äù), & four months later, UNSCOP made its recommendations that included a partition of Palestine into one Jewish state & one Arab state - each on approximately 50% of the Land (which, for the Jews, represented a mere 1/8 of the territory originally set aside for Jewish immigration and a Jewish State).\n\nThe Jews accepted the UN‚Äôs proposal, but the Arabs rejected it.\n\nSept 1947 - Attempts to Avoid War\n\nOn Sept 16, 1947, Zionist leaders met with the leader & secretary-general of the Arab League, Abdul Rahman Azzam Pasha.\n\nThe Zionist leaders pointed out the #UN had spoken, but also said they were ‚Äúgenuinely desirous of an agreement with the Arabs & [were] prepared to make sacrifices for one.‚Äù Generous compromises were offered.\n\nPasha, however, responded thusly: \n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs likely ‚Ä¶ that your plan is rational & logical, but the fate of nations is not decided by rational logic. Nations never concede; they fight. You won‚Äôt get anything by peaceful means or compromise. You can, perhaps, get something, but only by the force of arms. We shall try to defeat you. I‚Äôm not sure we‚Äôll succeed, but we‚Äôll try.‚Äù\n\nAbba Eban (later Israel‚Äôs first Ambassador to the UN) tried to reason with Pasha, saying he would ‚Äúwelcome any counterproposal from your side.‚Äù\n\nBut Pasha responded: \n\n‚ÄúAn agreement will only be acceptable at our terms ‚Ä¶ We have only one test, the test of strength. If I were a Zionist leader, I might have behaved the way you‚Äôre doing. You have no alternative. In all events, the problem now is only soluble by the force of arms.‚Äù\n\nOct 2, 1947 - Zionist Leaders Urge Reconciliation with Local Arabs\n\nThe Assembly of Palestine Jewry issued an appeal on Oct 2, 1947 that read: \n\n‚ÄúWe will do everything in our power to maintain peace, & establish a cooperation gainful to both [Jews & Arabs]. It is now, here & now, from Jerusalem itself, that a call must go out to the Arab nations to join forces with Jewry & the destined Jewish State and work shoulder to shoulder for our common good, for the peace and progress of sovereign equals.‚Äù\n\nThere was no similar call from the Arab world in response.\n\nNov 1947 - UN Partition Vote & Outbreak of Civil War\n\nOn Nov 29, 1947, the UN voted to approve General Assembly Resolution 181 adopting partition as recommended by UNSCOP.\n\nThe Jews celebrated international legitimacy for their State; but, like all UNGA Resolutions, 181 was a mere ‚Äúrecommendation.‚Äù\n\nSince the Arabs flatly rejected Resolution 181, there was no means by which the UN could enforce it.\n\nThe next day, Arabs attacked a Jewish bus on the Petah Tikva-Lod road, killing five passengers, & Jewish neighborhoods in and surrounding Jerusalem were attacked.\n\nA Civil War had begun.\n\nMay 1948 - Israeli Independence\n\nAt 8 a.m. on May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion declared independence for the State of Israel.\n\nBen-Gurion began by stating:\n\n‚ÄúIsrael was the birthplace of the Jewish people. Here their spiritual, religious and political identity was shaped. Here they first attained statehood, created cultural values of national & universal significance & gave to the world the eternal Book of Books.‚Äù\n\nBut Ben-Gurion also ended by stating:\n\n‚ÄúIn the midst of wanton aggression, we yet call upon the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel to preserve the ways of peace & play their part in the development of the State, on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its bodies and institutions ‚Ä¶ We extend our hand in peace & neighborliness to all the neighboring states and their peoples, and invite them to cooperate with the independent Jewish nation for the common good of all.\n\nOnly hours later, the neighboring Arab countries (#Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, #Iraq, and #Egypt) launched a full scale invasion of the nascent State of Israel.\n\nSec-Gen Azzam Pasha proclaimed, ‚ÄúThis will be a war of extermination & momentous massacre, which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacres & the Crusades.‚Äù\n\nPundits filled the airwaves with talk of a second Holocaust considering the Arab states had a population of 200 million with well-equipped armies, & Israel‚Äôs entire population was ~600,000 men, women, & children with no formal military training.\n\nPlus, both the United States & Britain maintained an arms embargo on Israel.\n\nHowever, in what was a true modern-day miracle, the Jews of the reconstituted Jewish State of Israel, a mere three years after the Holocaust & once again facing extermination, fought back the Arab armies to armistices signed in April 1949.\n\n#Education #Israel #Palestine"

She is in survival mode, going around and telling her story, shouting it so that people hear about what really happened that day.\n\nNo 14-year-old should have to endure this. I pray to Hashem that they bring Amit home, that Ella can heal from this horrible trauma, and that the Jewish people never have to go through anything like this ever again."

They broke down front doors and wiped out entire families eating dinner. Some families were murdered in bed, still wearing their pajamas. In many homes, children, three or four years old, were found in their pajamas, and blood-soaked blankets.... in many cases, the attackers dismembered their victims before killing them. They crushed the heads of children and babies against walls. Women and girls were raped before they were slaughtered with hatchets. Often, men were dragged out of their homes to be quickly and collectively executed in the street with hatchets and knives. The militants spread terror as they indiscriminately slaughtered men, women, children and the elderly ... a woman's arm was found chopped off at the wrist so that her jewelry could be stolen.\" \n\nI can list pages of massacres committed by the IDF that would put what happened on Oct 7th to shame! \n\nWe are not in a competition to try and justify acts of violence against civilians. We simply need to understand; where there is occupation and oppression, there will be resistance.\n\nWe might not understand or agree with the methods used by the resistance and refer to it as  terrorism.... But what do we know! Let's see how the men amongst us (if masculinity still exists in the West) would react if they were thrown from their homes, their children kidnapped, wives and daughters raped and brothers killed. Would real men sit idly by having witnessed the same happen to their parents and grandparents?\n\nI personally wouldn't."
